2024-12-26 05:28:27 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is my retrosynthetic analysis of the given molecule:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule is a complex glycopeptide antibiotic, likely related to vancomycin. Key structural features include:
- A heptapeptide backbone with several non-proteinogenic amino acids 
- Aromatic rings, including chlorinated tyrosine residues, that form cross-links
- Disaccharide attached to one of the tyrosine residues
- A long aliphatic chain, likely a lipid tail, attached to the N-terminus via an amide bond
</thinking>

<thinking>
One approach would be to disconnect the lipid tail from the heptapeptide. This could be accomplished by:
1) Hydrolysis of the amide bond linking the lipid to the peptide. This would require basic or enzymatic conditions.
2) Separately synthesizing the lipid tail and the linear heptapeptide, then coupling them via amide bond formation. The peptide could be made by solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS).
</thinking>

<thinking>
Another approach is to disconnect the disaccharide from the peptide backbone. Options include:
1) Glycosidic bond hydrolysis using acid or glycosidase enzymes. This would give the free peptide and disaccharide.
2) Separately synthesizing the peptide and disaccharide, then linking them via glycosylation. The disaccharide could be made by standard carbohydrate chemistry.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Within the peptide, the aromatic cross-links could be disconnected. Possibilities:
1) Oxidative phenolic coupling of the linear peptide. This would require oxidants like ferric chloride or sodium periodate.
2) Synthesizing peptide fragments, some with the cross-links pre-formed, then linking the fragments by peptide coupling. Careful protecting group strategy would be needed.
</thinking>

<thinking>
In summary, key disconnections could be made at the lipid-peptide linkage, the glycosidic bond, or the aromatic cross-links. A combination of peptide synthesis, carbohydrate synthesis, and biomimetic oxidative coupling could be used to reassemble the molecule from fragments. However, the synthesis would be highly challenging due to the molecule's size and complexity.

2024-12-26 05:30:56 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is my retrosynthetic analysis of the given molecule:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule is a complex glycopeptide antibiotic with multiple sugars, amino acids, and aromatic rings. Key structural features to consider for retrosynthesis:

- Glycosidic bonds connecting the sugars to the aromatic rings
- Peptide bonds between the amino acids 
- Biaryl ether linkage
- Chlorine substituents on two of the aromatic rings
</thinking>

<thinking>
Potential retrosynthetic disconnections, focusing on one transformation at a time:

1. Cleave the glycosidic bonds to separate the sugars from the aglycon. This could be achieved via hydrolysis (acid or enzymatic).

2. Disconnect the peptide bonds to give the individual amino acid building blocks. Peptide coupling would be used in the forward sense.

3. Break the biaryl ether C-O bond. Could be formed via a Buchwald-Hartwig or Chan-Lam coupling.

4. Disconnect C-Cl bonds. The chlorine atoms could be installed via late-stage aromatic halogenation.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Narrowing down to 3-5 specific suggestions:

1. Hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds
2. Peptide bond disconnection 
3. Biaryl ether disconnection
4. Chlorination

I'll depict each of these in SMILES notation as a single precursor, with the understanding that multiple steps would be needed to arrive at purchasable building blocks.

2024-12-26 05:32:14 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is my retrosynthetic analysis of the given molecule:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule is a complex glycopeptide antibiotic with multiple sugars, amino acids, and aromatic rings. Key structural features to consider for retrosynthesis:

- Glycosidic bonds connecting the sugars to the aromatic rings
- Peptide bonds between the amino acids 
- Biaryl ether linkage between two of the aromatic rings
- Chlorine substituents on two of the aromatic rings
</thinking>

<thinking>
Potential retrosynthetic disconnections, focusing on one transformation at a time:

1. Cleave the glycosidic bonds to separate the sugars from the aglycon. This could be achieved via hydrolysis (acid or enzymatic).

2. Disconnect the peptide bonds to give the individual amino acid building blocks. Peptide coupling would be used in the forward sense.

3. Break the biaryl ether C-O bond. This could be formed via an Ullmann ether synthesis or Chan-Lam coupling.

4. Remove the chlorine atoms on the aromatic rings. These could be installed via electrophilic aromatic substitution.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Evaluating the most promising retrosynthetic steps:

1. Cleaving the glycosidic bonds seems like a good first step to simplify the molecule. The individual sugars and aglycon could then be synthesized separately and recombined. 

2. Disconnecting the peptide bonds is also a reasonable approach. The linear peptide sequence could be prepared via standard solution-phase or solid-phase peptide synthesis methods.

3. The biaryl ether disconnection makes sense, but may be challenging depending on the substrates. Careful optimization of reaction conditions would be needed.

4. Dechlorination is straightforward, but installing the chlorine atoms via late-stage aromatic chlorination could be tricky due to potential competing sites of reactivity. 
</thinking>

<thinking>
Proposed retrosynthesis:

1. Cleave glycosidic bonds 
2. Disconnect peptide bonds
3. Break biaryl ether linkage
4. Remove chlorine substituents

The sugar, peptide, and aromatic building blocks could then be prepared separately and coupled together to assemble the final target molecule. Careful protecting group strategies and order of assembly will be critical.

<cot>
<thinking>
This is a highly complex molecule with multiple fused ring systems, including benzene rings, a pyrrole, and what appears to be a glycoside moiety. The presence of multiple stereocenters and amide bonds also adds to the complexity. 

One approach could be to disconnect one of the amide bonds, such as the one connecting the glycoside to the rest of the molecule. This would give two precursor fragments that could potentially be coupled together. The glycoside fragment could come from a protected sugar derivative, while the other fragment would still be quite complex.

Alternatively, we could try disconnecting the molecule at one of the ether bonds, like the one connecting the chlorinated benzene ring. This would give a phenol precursor and a secondary fragment. The phenol could potentially come from a halogenated salicylaldehyde precursor.

Another bond that could be disconnected is the one between the pyrrole nitrogen and the adjacent benzylic carbon. This would give an aminopyrrole precursor and a substituted benzaldehyde-like fragment. 

Given the number of amide bonds, we could also consider a late-stage amide coupling strategy between two key fragments. For example, disconnecting the rightmost amide bond would give a carboxylic acid and an amine fragment that could be coupled.

In any case, the precursors are likely to be complex molecules in their own right, and multiple protecting group manipulations and functional group interconversions would be needed. High-yielding, selective reactions would be critical given the likely high molecular weight of the intermediates. Careful control of stereochemistry would also be essential.
</thinking>

<thinking>
To summarize, here are some potential single-step disconnections:

1. Disconnect glycoside amide bond 
2. Disconnect ether to chlorinated benzene ring
3. Disconnect pyrrole N-benzylic C bond
4. Disconnect peripheral amide bond for late-stage coupling

The precursors would be complex and multiple steps would be needed to access them. Protecting group strategies, stereoselective reactions, and efficient coupling chemistry would be key to a successful synthesis.

2024-12-26 05:36:12 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is my attempt at a single-step retrosynthesis of the given molecule:

<cot>
<thinking>
This is a highly complex polycyclic molecule with multiple fused ring systems, including benzene rings, a pyrrole, and what appears to be a glycoside moiety. There are also multiple chiral centers. Key functional groups include phenols, amides, a carboxylic acid, and chlorine substituents.

One approach would be to disconnect the glycosidic bond, separating the sugar from the polycyclic aglycon. This could be formed via a glycosylation reaction. 

Another possibility is to break one of the amide bonds, which could be formed from an amine and carboxylic acid or acid chloride precursor. The chlorine substituents could be introduced via late-stage chlorination.

Disconnection of some of the C-C or C-N bonds in the fused ring systems could simplify the molecule, but may require more than one step. Ring-closing reactions like the Pictet-Spengler could be considered.

Given the complexity, a biomimetic or enzymatic approach involving late-stage tailoring of a complex natural product core could also be fruitful. However, identifying a suitable precursor would require more research.
</thinking>

<thinking>
To summarize, potential single-step retrosynthetic disconnections include:

1. Glycosidic bond - formed via glycosylation 
2. Amide bonds - formed via amide coupling
3. C-Cl bonds - formed via late-stage chlorination
4. C-C or C-N bonds in fused rings - may require multiple steps

Biomimetic approach using a natural product precursor is another possibility. Complexity and multiple stereocenters are the main challenges. More detailed analysis of the ring systems and stereochemistry would be needed to propose a complete synthetic route.

<thinking>
The target molecule contains a glycosidic linkage between a sugar (glucose) and an aromatic system. A reasonable retrosynthetic disconnection would be to break this glycosidic bond, giving the glucose and aromatic precursors separately. The aromatic portion looks like it could come from a Pictet-Spengler reaction between a tryptamine derivative and an aldehyde or ketone.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Another potential disconnection is the amide bonds. There are two amide linkages that could be broken. Disconnecting the amide bond in the larger ring system would give an amino acid (likely tyrosine or DOPA) and a lactam. Breaking the other amide bond would give a different amino acid derivative and a simpler amide.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The target also contains several chiral alcohols on the glucose ring. These could come from selective reductions of the corresponding ketones or aldehydes. Alternatively, the chirality could be set using an enantioselective aldol reaction or other stereoselective C-C bond forming reaction.
</thinking>

<thinking>
In terms of protecting group strategies, the phenolic OH groups would likely need to be protected as ethers or esters during the synthesis. The alcohols on the glucose ring may also need protection, possibly as silyl ethers or acetates. The amines would likely be protected as carbamates.
</thinking>

2024-12-26 05:38:34 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the retrosynthetic analysis for the given molecule:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains a glycoside linkage between a sugar (glucose) and a phenol. A reasonable retrosynthetic disconnection would be to break this O-glycosidic bond, giving a glucose derivative and the phenol precursor. The phenol has a fused dihydropyrimidinone ring with an amine substituent, which could arise from a cyclocondensation reaction.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Another potential precursor could be formed by disconnecting the anomeric C-O bond in the glucose ring, giving a hemiacetal intermediate that could be derived from a protected glucose derivative by deprotection. The phenol fragment would remain the same.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The dihydropyrimidinone ring could also be disconnected retrosynthetically in various ways. One approach is to break the N-C bond adjacent to the ketone, giving a β-ketoamide intermediate. This could be formed by acylation of the corresponding aminophenol with an activated malonate derivative. 
</thinking>

<thinking>
Alternatively, disconnecting the other N-C bond in the dihydropyrimidinone would give a urea derivative, which could be formed by reaction of the aminophenol with an isocyanate. Disconnection of the C-C bond in the 6-membered ring would give an imine intermediate, potentially formed by condensation of the aminophenol with an aldehyde or ketone.
</thinking>

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains a dihydroisoquinoline core with a chiral center at the C3 position. Key disconnections to consider are:
1) Amide bond formation from a carboxylic acid and amine 
2) Pictet-Spengler cyclization of a phenethylamine derivative
3) Reduction of a nitro group to form the amine
4) Bischler-Napieralski cyclization of an amide followed by reduction
</thinking>

<thinking>
Disconnection of the amide bond could lead back to 2-amino-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid and methylamine. The amino acid could potentially be accessed by reduction of the corresponding nitro compound.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The dihydroisoquinoline core could be formed via a Pictet-Spengler cyclization. This would involve condensation of a phenethylamine derivative (dopamine or similar) with an aldehyde, followed by cyclization. 
</thinking>

<thinking>
Alternatively, a Bischler-Napieralski cyclization of a substituted N-methylphenethylamide, followed by reduction, could give the dihydroisoquinoline. The amide could come from an acylation reaction.

To simplify the retrosynthesis, I will focus on disconnecting the molecule into amino acid building blocks and the sugar moiety. Key disconnection points are the amide bonds between amino acids and the glycosidic bond to the tyrosine.

Possible precursors include:
1) The individual amino acids, which could be coupled sequentially or convergently to build up the peptide. These include tyrosine, 3-chlorotyrosine, and an unnatural amino acid derived from 3,5-dichlorotyrosine. The amino acids would be protected as needed.  
2) A glycosylated tyrosine building block, which could come from tyrosine and a protected glucose derivative.
3) Smaller peptide fragments that could be coupled together to form the macrocycle. 
4) A linear precursor peptide that could be cyclized to form the final product.

Amide bond formation could be achieved with standard peptide coupling reagents like HATU or PyBOP. The macrocyclization would require high dilution conditions. The key glycosylation could be installed via a glycosyl donor like a trichloroacetimidate under Lewis acid catalysis.
</thinking>

<thinking>
To generate the precursor SMILES, I will break the molecule into three key fragments:

Fragment 1: The western half containing two 3-chlorotyrosines
Fragment 2: The eastern half containing a 3,5-dichlorotyrosine and a tyrosine
Fragment 3: The glucose moiety

I'll propose SMILES for reasonable protected versions of these fragments. The final step would involve fragment coupling and deprotection.

2024-12-26 05:43:44 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the retrosynthetic analysis for the given molecule:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains an amide bond connecting two amino acid-like fragments, each with a 4-chloro-3-hydroxyphenyl group. This suggests a peptide coupling reaction as a key retrosynthetic step.
</thinking>

<thinking>
One fragment contains a primary amine and a carboxylic acid, resembling the amino acid glycine. The other fragment has a secondary amine and carboxylic acid, similar to a substituted phenylalanine. Disconnecting the amide bond would give these two amino acid precursors.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The two aromatic rings could come from electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, installing the chloro and hydroxy groups on a phenyl ring. The amino acids themselves could be formed by reductive amination (for the glycine-like fragment) and an asymmetric Strecker synthesis (for the phenylalanine-like fragment).
</thinking>

<thinking>
In summary, key retrosynthetic steps are:
1. Amide bond disconnection via hydrolysis 
2. Aromatic substitution to install Cl and OH groups
3. Reductive amination and Strecker synthesis to form amino acid precursors

2024-12-26 05:45:56 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the retrosynthetic analysis for the given molecule:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains several key features:
- Two peptide bonds, suggesting it is a tripeptide
- Two substituted phenylalanine residues with chloro and hydroxy substituents 
- A central amino acid residue with a furan-substituted benzyl side chain
- The C-terminus is a carboxylic acid while the N-terminus has a free amine

Potential disconnections:
1) Cleave the two peptide bonds to give three amino acid building blocks 
2) Disconnect the furan-containing side chains on the Phe residues
3) Potentially simplify the highly substituted aromatic rings on the Phe residues
</thinking>

<thinking>
Suggestion 1: Cleave peptide bonds
- Disconnect the two peptide bonds 
- This gives the three amino acid building blocks: 
  1) H2N-Phe(3-Cl,4-OH)-CO2H
  2) HO2C-Phe(4-OCH2-furan)-NH2  
  3) H2N-Xaa-CO2H where Xaa is the central amino acid with the complex side chain
- These amino acids can be coupled using standard peptide synthesis conditions (e.g. HATU, DIEA)
- The central Xaa residue would need to be synthesized separately
</thinking>

<thinking>
Suggestion 2: Disconnect furan side chains
- Disconnect the OCH2-furan groups on the Phe residues 
- This gives Phe residues with free phenol groups
- The furan-containing alkylating agent can be made separately, e.g. from furfuryl alcohol
- The alkylation could be done before or after incorporating the Phe residues into the peptide
</thinking>

<thinking>
Suggestion 3: Simplify substituted Phe residues  
- The highly substituted Phe residues could be synthesized from simpler precursors
- For example, disconnect the 3-Cl and 4-OH groups
- This gives a simple Phe residue which can be elaborated via aromatic substitution reactions
- Chlorination and hydroxylation reactions would need to be developed
</thinking>

2024-12-26 05:48:08 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the retrosynthetic analysis for the given molecule:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains three amino acid residues linked by amide bonds. The C-terminal residue has a carboxylic acid, indicating it is the free C-terminus. The N-terminal residue has a free amine, indicating it is the free N-terminus. 

One approach is to disconnect the amide bonds between the amino acids. This would give the three individual amino acids, which could then be coupled together using standard peptide coupling reagents like HATU or PyBOP.

Another approach is to keep the dipeptide on the right intact, and couple it with the N-terminal amino acid. The dipeptide could be formed first via a separate peptide coupling.

A third approach is to keep the dipeptide on the left intact, and couple it with the C-terminal amino acid.

For the non-peptidic parts, the furan ring could be installed via an SN2 reaction between the phenol of tyrosine and a substituted furan bromide or tosylate. The aromatic chlorine substituents could be installed via electrophilic aromatic substitution on the tyrosine precursors.
</thinking>

<thinking>
To summarize:
1. Disconnect all amide bonds, giving three amino acid precursors 
2. Form the right dipeptide, then couple with the left amino acid
3. Form the left dipeptide, then couple with the right amino acid
4. Install furan via SN2 on tyrosine phenol 
5. Install aromatic chlorines via electrophilic aromatic substitution on tyrosine precursors

2024-12-26 05:49:41 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the retrosynthetic analysis for the given molecule:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains two peptide bonds, suggesting it could be formed via a peptide coupling reaction between two amino acid derivatives. The two halogenated aromatic rings with ether substituents indicate the amino acids are likely tyrosine derivatives that have undergone O-alkylation and halogenation.
</thinking>

<thinking>
One retrosynthetic approach would be to disconnect the peptide bonds, giving two tyrosine derivatives. The C-terminal tyrosine has a furan-containing ether, which could be installed via Williamson ether synthesis from a halogenated furan and the phenol of tyrosine. The N-terminal tyrosine simply has a chlorine substituent. Both tyrosine derivatives would need protecting groups on the amine and carboxylic acid.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Alternatively, the peptide could be constructed in a linear fashion by first coupling the N-terminal tyrosine derivative to an amino acid like glycine, serine or alanine. The resulting dipeptide could then be coupled to the C-terminal tyrosine derivative. This approach would require selective protecting group strategies.
</thinking>

<thinking>
A third approach would be to start from a tripeptide containing a tyrosine or phenylalanine in the middle position. The aromatic rings of the outer amino acids could then be functionalized via electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions to install the chlorine and alkyl ether groups. The phenol of the central amino acid would need to be protected as an ether.
</thinking>

2024-12-26 05:51:16 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the single-step retrosynthesis analysis for the given molecule:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains several key functional groups and structural features to consider for retrosynthesis:
1. An acid chloride (C(=O)Cl) at one end
2. A tert-butyl ester (C(=O)OC(C)(C)C) at the other end 
3. A secondary amide (NC(=O)) linking the two ends
4. A substituted benzyl group (Cc1cc(...)) in the middle, with chlorine and ether substituents
5. A furan ring (oc(C)cc) attached to the benzyl ether

Based on these, several retrosynthetic disconnections are possible. The most promising appear to be:
- Disconnecting the amide bond, giving the amine and acid chloride precursors 
- Disconnecting the ester, giving the carboxylic acid and tert-butanol
- Disconnecting the benzyl ether, giving the substituted benzyl alcohol and furan precursors
</thinking>

For the amide disconnection, a reasonable pathway is acylation of the chiral amine H2N[C@@H](Cc1cc(OCc2oc(C)cc2)c(Cl)cc1Cl)C(=O)OC(C)(C)C with the acid chloride ClC(=O)Cl. This would likely proceed with a base like triethylamine or pyridine.
</thinking>

<thinking>
For the ester disconnection, hydrolysis of the tert-butyl ester under acidic conditions would give the carboxylic acid O=C(Cl)N[C@@H](Cc1cc(OCc2oc(C)cc2)c(Cl)cc1Cl)C(=O)O. The tert-butyl ester could be installed by esterification of this acid with tert-butanol under acidic conditions.
</thinking>

<thinking>
For the ether disconnection, the benzyl ether could be formed by etherification of the substituted benzyl alcohol OC[C@H](NC(=O)Cl)C(=O)OC(C)(C)C with the furan derivative Cc1occc1. This would require a base like sodium hydride or potassium carbonate. The benzyl alcohol precursor could be accessed by reducing the corresponding aldehyde or acid.

2024-12-26 05:51:51 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the retrosynthetic analysis for oxalyl chloride (ClC(=O)Cl):

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule ClC(=O)Cl is oxalyl chloride. It is a simple acyl chloride with two C=O groups and two Cl atoms. 

Some potential retrosynthetic disconnections to consider:
1. Break one of the C-Cl bonds to give an acyl chloride and Cl-. This would be the reverse of an acyl chloride formation reaction from a carboxylic acid.
2. Break the central C-C bond to give two equivalents of phosgene (COCl2). This would be the reverse of a coupling reaction between two phosgene molecules.
3. Break both C-Cl bonds to give oxalic acid and two Cl-. This would be the reverse of converting a dicarboxylic acid to the diacyl chloride.

Given the simplicity of the molecule, there are not many other productive retrosynthetic steps to consider. The most plausible precursors are a carboxylic acid, phosgene, or oxalic acid.
</thinking>

<thinking>
To form oxalyl chloride from a carboxylic acid precursor:
- The precursor would be oxalic acid monochloride, a half-acid, half-acyl chloride 
- React with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) or phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) to convert the -COOH group to -COCl
- Confidence is high since this is a very common reaction for synthesizing acyl chlorides
</thinking>

<thinking>
To form oxalyl chloride from phosgene:
- Simply need to couple two phosgene molecules
- Could be achieved via a Lewis acid catalyzed dimerization 
- Moderate confidence as I'm less certain of the specific conditions needed for the coupling
</thinking>

<thinking>
To form oxalyl chloride from oxalic acid:
- React oxalic acid with excess thionyl chloride (SOCl2) or phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5)
- Will convert both -COOH groups to -COCl 
- High confidence as this is a very reliable way to convert a dicarboxylic acid to the diacyl chloride

2024-12-26 05:52:09 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the retrosynthetic analysis for oxalyl chloride (ClC(=O)Cl):

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule ClC(=O)Cl is oxalyl chloride. It is a highly reactive acyl chloride with two C-Cl bonds and a C=O double bond.

Possible retrosynthetic disconnections include:
1) Breaking one of the C-Cl bonds to give chlorooxoacetyl chloride. This could be formed by chlorination of oxoacetic acid.
2) Breaking both C-Cl bonds to give oxalic acid. The diacid could then be converted to the diacyl chloride using a chlorinating agent like thionyl chloride or phosphorus pentachloride.
3) Disconnecting the central C-C bond to give two equivalents of phosgene (COCl2). Phosgene is a common precursor to acyl chlorides.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The molecule is simple enough that more than 3 meaningful precursors are difficult to propose. The most plausible retrosyntheses involve disconnecting the C-Cl bonds and/or the central C-C bond. Oxoacetic acid derivatives and phosgene are the key precursors that come to mind.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains several key functional groups and structural features to consider for retrosynthesis:
1. A chiral amine (N[C@@H])  
2. A substituted benzene ring with two chlorine atoms and an ether linkage
3. A furan ring attached via a methylene linker to the ether oxygen
4. A tert-butyl ester protecting group (C(=O)OC(C)(C)C) on the amine
Potential disconnections could be made at the ether linkage, the amide bond, or by simplifying the substituted benzene ring.
</thinking>

<thinking>
One approach would be to disconnect at the ether linkage between the substituted benzene and furan rings. This could be formed via a Williamson ether synthesis between an alkoxide and a benzyl halide or tosylate. The precursors would be:
1. N[C@@H](Cc1cc(O)c(Cl)cc1Cl)C(=O)OC(C)(C)C (chiral amine with a phenol) 
2. BrCc1oc(C)cc1 (bromomethyl furan)
</thinking>

<thinking>
The amide bond could also be disconnected, giving an amine and an activated ester or acid chloride. Potential precursors:
1. N[C@@H](Cc1cc(OCc2oc(C)cc2)c(Cl)cc1Cl)C(=O)Cl (acid chloride)
2. OC(C)(C)C (tert-butanol)
The stereochemistry would need to be controlled in the amide bond formation.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The dichlorobenzene ring could be formed via an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, such as a chlorination of a mono-chloro precursor. Precursors:
1. N[C@@H](Cc1cc(OCc2oc(C)cc2)c(Cl)cc1)C(=O)OC(C)(C)C (mono-chloro intermediate)

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains an N-substituted amino acid with a tert-butyl ester protecting group and a 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzyl side chain.

Possible retrosynthetic disconnections:
1. Cleave the tert-butyl ester to reveal the carboxylic acid. This could be formed via a standard amino acid synthesis using the appropriate side chain.
2. Disconnect the benzylic C-N bond. The amine could be installed via reductive amination of the corresponding aldehyde or SN2 reaction with a benzyl halide.
3. Remove the hydroxy group on the aromatic ring. This could reveal a phenol that underwent late-stage chlorination, or a methoxy group that was demethylated.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Evaluating the side chain, the 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzyl group is an uncommon substructure. It may be challenging to source this as a precursor for the amino acid synthesis.
Performing the chlorination and demethylation late-stage on the fully assembled amino acid derivative could be a better approach. 
</thinking>

<thinking>
The tert-butyl ester could be installed via a standard esterification reaction on the carboxylic acid. Alternatively, it may be carried through the synthesis if starting from a suitably protected aspartic acid derivative.
</thinking>

<thinking>
In summary, a promising retrosynthesis could involve:
1. Tert-butyl ester formation from the carboxylic acid
2. Chlorination and demethylation to install the 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxy pattern 
3. Reductive amination to form the N-benzyl group
4. Amino acid synthesis using an aspartic acid derivative and the appropriate aldehyde to set the side chain stereocenter

2024-12-26 05:55:16 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the single-step retrosynthesis for the target molecule N[C@@H](Cc1cc(O)c(Cl)cc1Cl)C(=O)O:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains an amino acid moiety with a substituted dichlorophenol side chain. Possible retrosynthetic disconnections include:
1. Amide bond formation from an amine and carboxylic acid 
2. Alkylation of the amine with a benzyl halide
3. Reduction of a nitro group to form the amine
4. Chlorination of the phenol ring
5. Asymmetric synthesis to set the chiral center
</thinking>

<thinking>
For the amide bond, the amine could come from reduction of an α-amino nitrile, Gabriel synthesis, reductive amination, or a chiral pool amino acid. The carboxylic acid could come from oxidation of an alcohol or aldehyde, hydrolysis of an ester or nitrile, or a Grignard addition to CO2.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The substituted benzyl group could come from reduction of the corresponding aldehyde, cyanide or alkene. The dichlorophenol could be formed by electrophilic aromatic substitution of phenol. 
</thinking>

<thinking>
Putting this together, some possible precursors are:
1. Cl[C@H](N)Cc1cc(O)c(Cl)cc1Cl + HOOC-H (amide coupling)
2. N[C@@H](CO)Cc1cc(O)c(Cl)cc1Cl (alcohol oxidation)  
3. N[C@@H](Cc1cc(O)c(Cl)cc1Cl)C#N (nitrile hydrolysis)
4. O=C(Cl)[C@H](N)Cc1cc(O)c(Cl)cc1Cl (acyl chloride formation, then amide coupling)
5. N[C@@H](Cc1ccc(O)cc1)C(=O)O + Cl2 (late stage chlorination)

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains an amino acid moiety with a substituted dichlorophenol side chain. Possible retrosynthetic disconnections include:

1. Amide bond formation: Disconnecting the amide C-N bond, which could be formed from an amine and a carboxylic acid or activated carboxylic acid derivative. The carboxylic acid contains the dichlorophenol side chain.

2. Alkylation: Disconnecting the benzylic C-C bond between the amino acid α-carbon and the dichlorophenol ring. This suggests an alkylation reaction between a glycine equivalent and a benzyl halide or sulfonate containing the dichlorophenol.

3. Reduction: The carboxylic acid could be formed by oxidation of an alcohol or aldehyde. Alternatively, the amine could be formed by reduction of a nitrile, azide, or nitro group.

4. Aromatic substitution: The dichlorophenol could be formed by electrophilic aromatic substitution of a phenol with a chlorinating agent like SO2Cl2. The phenol itself could come from various precursors.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Based on these options, the most plausible precursors and reactions are:

1. Amide coupling of 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and glycine 
2. Alkylation of a glycine equivalent with 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzyl halide or sulfonate
3. Oxidation of (3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-L-alaninol
4. Chlorination of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid to form 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, followed by amide coupling with glycine

2024-12-26 05:59:13 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the retrosynthetic analysis for the target molecule N[C@@H]1[C@H]([C@@H]([C@H](O[C@H]1O)O)O)O:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule appears to be a sugar, likely glucose based on the stereochemistry and substituents. The key structural features are:
- Cyclic hemiacetal ring 
- 5 stereocenters with defined stereochemistry
- 4 secondary alcohols and 1 primary amine
Potential retrosynthetic disconnections could target the cyclic hemiacetal, the alcohols, or the amine. Ring-opening of the hemiacetal could lead to an aldehyde precursor. The alcohols and amine could come from reductions of carbonyls and a nitrile/azide respectively.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Suggestion 1: Ring-opening of the hemiacetal
- This would give an open-chain aldehyde precursor
- The aldehyde and alcohols could come from selective oxidations of a polyol 
- Stereochemistry would need to be set correctly, likely via asymmetric synthesis or chiral pool starting material
</thinking>

<thinking>
Suggestion 2: Alcohol reductions
- The secondary alcohols could come from ketone reductions
- This implies a precursor with multiple ketones
- Stereochemistry of the reductions would need to be controlled
- The cyclic hemiacetal could then form via intramolecular cyclization of the aldehyde and one of the alcohols
</thinking>

<thinking>
Suggestion 3: Amine formation
- The primary amine could come from reduction of a nitrile or azide 
- This disconnection doesn't directly help with constructing the rest of the molecule
- The nitrile/azide precursor would still contain the cyclic sugar core
- This is likely a later stage transformation after constructing the sugar backbone
</thinking>

<thinking>
In summary, the key retrosynthetic steps appear to be:
1. Ring-opening of the hemiacetal to reveal an aldehyde 
2. Reductions of ketones to form the secondary alcohols
3. Reduction of a nitrile or azide to form the primary amine

The most promising approach is likely a combination of suggestions 1 and 2. Suggestion 3 could be incorporated after the core sugar structure is assembled. Stereochemistry will be a key challenge that will require careful control and planning.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains an aldehyde (C=O) and a nitrile (C≡N) functional group. It also has four hydroxyl (-OH) groups on adjacent carbons, indicating a carbohydrate-like structure. 

One approach could be to form the molecule via oxidation of the corresponding primary alcohol to the aldehyde. The precursor would have a CH2OH group instead of the CHO.

Another possibility is forming the nitrile via dehydration of the corresponding amide (CONH2 group). So a precursor could have an amide in place of the nitrile.

The multiple hydroxyls could come from oxidation of alkenes, so precursors with C=C double bonds in place of the C-OH groups are an option.

The molecule could also be formed via cyanation (adding the CN group) of the corresponding molecule lacking the nitrile, using a reagent like NaCN.

Alternatively, the aldehyde could be formed by oxidative cleavage of a vicinal diol (two OH groups on adjacent carbons). So a precursor with an extra OH in place of the aldehyde is possible.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Based on these options, I propose the following 5 possible precursor molecules and reactions, in order of my confidence in each retrosynthetic pathway:

1. N#CC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CH2OH, formed via alcohol oxidation to aldehyde 
2. N#CC(O)C(O)C(O)C(OH)=CH2, formed via alkene oxidation to alcohol
3. N#CC(O)C(OH)C(OH)C(OH)2, formed via vicinal diol cleavage to aldehyde
4. H2NC(=O)C(O)C(O)C(O)C=O, formed via amide dehydration to nitrile
5. OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C=O, formed via cyanation to add nitrile group

I'm most confident in the alcohol oxidation and alkene oxidation routes, as those are common reactions to form aldehydes and alcohols respectively. The diol cleavage is also a known way to make aldehydes.

The amide dehydration and cyanation paths are less certain, as those reactions can have side reactions or may not be as efficient. But they are still reasonable retrosynthetic steps to consider.

The target molecule contains an aldehyde (C=O), a nitrile (C#N), and four secondary alcohols. Potential disconnections include:
1) Oxidation of the terminal alcohol to form the aldehyde. The precursor would be N#CC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CH2OH.
2) Nucleophilic addition of cyanide to an aldehyde to form the nitrile. The precursor aldehyde would be OHC-C(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)C=O. 
3) Reduction of a ketone to form one of the secondary alcohols. For example, reducing N#CC(O)C(=O)C(O)C(O)C=O would give the target.
4) Protecting group chemistry - the alcohols could be protected (e.g. as acetates or TBS ethers), then deprotected to reveal the free alcohols in the final step.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The linear chain of secondary alcohols could arise from oxidative cleavage of a vicinal diol or alkene. For example, treating HO-CH=CH-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CHO with OsO4/NaIO4 would cleave the alkene to give the tetraol.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The molecule is a linear sugar-like compound. It could potentially be made by sequential nucleophilic addition to a protected glyceraldehyde derivative, e.g. TBS-O-CH2-CH(OTBS)-CHO. Cyanide addition, then alcohol deprotection/oxidation would give the target.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains two aldehyde groups on either end of a chain of four secondary alcohols. Possible retrosynthetic disconnections include:

1. Oxidation of the corresponding tetraol (HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH2-OH) using a strong oxidant like PCC or Swern conditions. This would be a reliable two-step oxidation of the primary alcohols to aldehydes.

2. Reduction of the corresponding tetraacid (HO2C-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CO2H) using a strong reducing agent like LiAlH4. The tetraacid could come from oxidation of glucose.

3. Selective oxidation of the primary hydroxyls in glucose (HO-CH2-(CHOH)4-CHO) under controlled conditions. May be challenging to prevent over-oxidation.

4. Oxidative ring-opening of 2,3,4,5-tetrahydroxycyclopentanone, likely under strong oxidative conditions. Obtaining this starting material may be challenging.

5. Double nucleophilic addition of hydroxide to the corresponding tetraenedial (O=CH-(CH=CH)2-CH=O), followed by tautomerization. Likely a very challenging synthesis to control.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The two most plausible routes are oxidation of the tetraol or reduction of the tetraacid. The tetraol should be readily accessible by reduction of glucose and is the most direct precursor. The tetraacid is also a plausible precursor but would require an additional oxidation step from glucose.

Selective oxidation of glucose is conceptually appealing as a one-step route, but achieving the desired chemoselectivity and preventing over-oxidation may be very challenging in practice.

The cyclopentanone route is creative but the starting material is not readily available and the oxidative ring-opening could be difficult to control.

The tetraenedial route is likely the least feasible, as the precursor would be unstable and the double addition would be very difficult to achieve selectively.

2024-12-26 06:03:46 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the single-step retrosynthesis analysis for the target molecule O=CC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)C=O:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains two aldehyde groups on either end of a chain of four carbons, each bearing a hydroxyl group. This is a highly oxidized molecule. Potential retrosynthetic disconnections include:

1. Oxidation of the corresponding tetraol (HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH2-OH) using a strong oxidant like PCC or Swern conditions. This would be a double oxidation of the primary alcohols to aldehydes.

2. Reduction of the corresponding carboxylic acid (HO2C-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CO2H) using a selective reducing agent like DIBAL-H at low temperatures. This would reduce the carboxylic acids to aldehydes while preserving the secondary alcohols.

3. Selective protection of the secondary alcohols in the tetraol (HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH2-OH), followed by oxidation of the primary alcohols to aldehydes, then deprotection. Common alcohol protecting groups like TBS ethers or acetates could be used.

4. Oxidative cleavage of the corresponding hex-5-ene-1,2,3,4-tetraol (HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH=CH2) using strong oxidants like ozone or OsO4/NaIO4. This would cleave the double bond to give the dialdehyde product.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The tetraol precursor in suggestion 1 seems like the most direct route, as it would only require a double oxidation. The carboxylic acid route in suggestion 2 is also reasonable. 

Suggestions 3 and 4 are more involved, requiring additional protection/deprotection steps or the synthesis of more complex precursors. They are less likely to be the most efficient routes.

Based on this analysis, I would prioritize suggestions 1 and 2 as the most promising retrosynthetic pathways. Suggestion 1 is likely the best choice if the tetraol precursor is readily available.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains three Pb-O bonds, which are likely formed via reaction of an alcohol with a lead reagent. The symmetric structure with terminal hydroxyl groups suggests the precursor is a tetraol.
</thinking>

<thinking>
One likely precursor is the tetraol OCC(O)C(O)C(O)CO, which could be reacted with a lead reagent like lead(II) acetate or lead(II) oxide to form the target molecule. The reaction would substitute the hydrogens of the alcohol groups with lead.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Alternatively, the precursor could be a partially protected tetraol like OCC(OC(=O)CH3)C(OC(=O)CH3)C(OC(=O)CH3)CO, with acetate protecting groups. Reaction with a lead reagent would substitute the acetates with lead. Subsequent deprotection of any remaining acetates would give the target molecule.
</thinking>

<thinking>
A third possibility is building the molecule from two protected glycerol units like OCC(OC(=O)CH3)C(OC(=O)CH3)CBr. An organometallic coupling reaction could join the two fragments, followed by reaction with lead reagent and deprotection.

<thinking>
The target molecule contains three Pb-O bonds, which are likely formed via reaction of hydroxyl groups with a lead reagent. The symmetric structure with terminal hydroxyl groups suggests it may be formed from a sugar or sugar alcohol precursor.
</thinking>

<thinking>
One likely precursor is mannitol, a sugar alcohol with the structure OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO. The three secondary hydroxyl groups could be selectively reacted with a lead reagent like lead(II) acetate or lead(II) oxide to form the target molecule. The primary hydroxyls would be less reactive.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Alternatively, the molecule could be formed from a partially protected triol, where the terminal hydroxyl groups are protected and the three internal hydroxyls are free to react with the lead reagent. Possibilities include 1,2,5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-mannitol or 1,2,5,6-di-O-cyclohexylidene-mannitol. The protecting groups could be removed after lead incorporation.
</thinking>

<thinking>
A third possibility is lead-promoted opening of a cyclic sugar acetal or ketal, such as 1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-D-mannitol. The lead could coordinate to the oxygens and promote C-O bond cleavage to generate the linear product.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule appears to be a sugar derivative, likely glucose or a similar monosaccharide, with multiple hydroxyl groups. The key structural features are the 6-membered ring containing an oxygen (pyranose form) and the hydroxymethyl group at the anomeric position.
</thinking>

<thinking>
One retrosynthetic approach could involve hydrolysis of the acetal/ketal linkage in the ring, which would open up the cyclic structure. This could be achieved under acidic aqueous conditions. The resulting precursor would be an acyclic polyol.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Another approach could be to consider functional group interconversions of the hydroxyl groups. For example, selective protection of some hydroxyl groups followed by oxidation of the remaining OH to an aldehyde or carboxylic acid could lead to a useful precursor. Subsequent deprotection and reduction steps could then afford the target molecule.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The hydroxymethyl group at the anomeric position could also be a target for retrosynthesis. This could have been installed via a nucleophilic addition of a formyl anion equivalent (e.g. from a Grignard reagent) to the carbonyl group of a glucose derivative. The precursor in this case would have a free anomeric hydroxyl group.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Given the high density of hydroxyl groups, selective protection and deprotection strategies will likely be necessary in any efficient synthesis of this molecule. Orthogonal protecting groups allowing for independent deprotection could be particularly useful.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains an aldehyde functional group (C=O) attached to a cyclic sugar-like structure. Possible retrosynthetic disconnections to consider:

1. Oxidation of the primary alcohol to form the aldehyde. The precursor would be the corresponding alcohol.

2. Hemiacetal formation between the aldehyde and one of the secondary alcohols. The precursors would be the linear sugar alcohol and formaldehyde.

3. Reduction of a carboxylic acid or ester to form the aldehyde. Precursors could be the corresponding carboxylic acid or ester.

4. Addition of a carbon nucleophile (e.g. Grignard reagent) to a protected sugar lactone, followed by oxidation. This would involve a multi-step sequence.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The most direct retrosynthesis would be the oxidation of the primary alcohol:

OCC1OC(C(O)C(O)C1O)CH2OH --> OCC1OC(C(O)C(O)C1O)C=O

This could be accomplished using a mild oxidant like PCC or TEMPO under standard conditions. The precursor alcohol should be easily accessible.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The hemiacetal formation is also a reasonable retrosynthetic step:

OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CH2OH + CH2O --> OCC1OC(C(O)C(O)C1O)C=O

However, this may be less favorable as it requires the sugar to be in the linear aldehyde form, which is often a minor component in equilibrium with cyclic hemiacetals. Aqueous conditions would be needed.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Reduction of a carboxylic acid or ester is a possibility, but less likely to be used in this case, as it adds extra steps and the aldehyde is the desired product, not a synthetic intermediate. 

The Grignard addition approach would involve multiple steps and protecting group manipulations. It's not an ideal route for a single-step retrosynthesis.
</thinking>

2024-12-26 06:08:17 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the single-step retrosynthesis analysis for the target molecule OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule is a linear polyol with 6 carbons and 6 hydroxy groups. It appears to be a sugar alcohol, likely D-mannitol or D-sorbitol. 

Some potential retrosynthetic precursors could be:
1) The corresponding aldose sugar (e.g. D-mannose or D-glucose) via reduction of the aldehyde
2) Selective protection and reduction of the aldehyde in the aldose sugar 
3) Oxidation of a terminal -CH2OH to an aldehyde, followed by reduction
4) Grignard addition to a protected tetraol followed by deprotection
5) Wittig olefination followed by dihydroxylation

The most straightforward route is likely reduction of the aldose sugar. Protecting group strategies could also work but add more steps. The oxidation/reduction sequence is less selective. Grignard and Wittig approaches are more complex and lower-yielding.
</thinking>

<thinking>
To generate the aldose sugar precursor, we can oxidize the terminal -CH2OH to an aldehyde. The SMILES for D-mannose would be: 
OC[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)C=O

And for D-glucose:
OC[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)C=O

These differ only in stereochemistry. Reduction with a hydride reagent like NaBH4 would give the target molecule.
</thinking>

<thinking>
An alternative approach could use protection of 4 of the 5 hydroxy groups in the aldose, reduction to the alcohol, then global deprotection. For example, starting from D-glucose:

1) Protection 
OC[C@H](OP)[C@@H](OP)[C@H](OP)[C@H](OP)C=O
where P is a protecting group like acetate or benzyl ether 

2) Reduction
OC[C@H](OP)[C@@H](OP)[C@H](OP)[C@H](OP)C[OH]

3) Deprotection to give the target molecule
</thinking>

<thinking>
The oxidation/reduction sequence is another possibility, but less selective. Starting from a pentaol:

1) Oxidation 
OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)C=O

2) Reduction
OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO

However, the oxidation may not be selective for the terminal -CH2OH over the other hydroxy groups.

Some potential retrosynthetic precursors could be:
1) The corresponding aldose sugar (e.g. D-mannose or D-glucose) via reduction of the aldehyde

4) The molecule is simple enough that it may be commercially available and not require synthesis
</thinking>

<thinking>
To generate the corresponding aldose sugars, the SMILES would be:
D-Mannose: OC[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)C=O
D-Glucose: OC[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)C=O

Selective protection of all but the anomeric OH, followed by reduction, could give the target. An example using acetonide protection:
OC[C@H]1OC(C)(C)O[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H]1O

Terminal oxidation to the aldehyde:
OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)C=O
Followed by Wittig and hydroboration/oxidation.
</thinking>

<thinking>
In summary, the potential retrosynthetic pathways are:
1) Reduction of aldose sugars 
2) Selective protection of aldose sugars followed by reduction
3) Oxidation, Wittig olefination, and hydroboration of one terminus
4) Commercial availability 

The aldose sugar pathway seems most direct. Selective protection adds steps. The oxidation/olefination route is longer. Commercial availability is possible for a simple target.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule is a linear polyol with 6 carbons and 6 hydroxy groups. It appears to be a sugar alcohol, likely D-mannitol or D-sorbitol. 

Some potential retrosynthetic precursors could be:
1. Selective oxidation of the primary alcohol in D-glucose to form D-gluconic acid, followed by reduction. This would give a mixture of D-sorbitol and D-mannitol.
2. Hydrogenation of D-fructose. This would also produce a mixture of the two epimeric sugar alcohols.
3. Reduction of a protected sugar like diacetone-D-glucose, followed by deprotection. This could allow selective formation of one epimer or the other.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The molecule is achiral, so distinguishing between D-sorbitol and D-mannitol is not necessary. The hydroxy groups are all secondary except for the two terminal primary alcohols. 

Another potential precursor is:
4. Hydrolysis of a bis-epoxide formed from E-hex-3-ene. The epoxide would need to be opened with hydroxide under aqueous conditions to install the correct stereochemistry at each position.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Given the simplicity of the target molecule, a short synthesis from readily available carbohydrates seems most promising. The key challenge is controlling the stereochemistry.

A final precursor to consider is:
5. Selective epimerization of D-glucitol (sorbitol). With the right catalyst and conditions, it may be possible to equilibrate to pure D-mannitol. However, this would likely be low-yielding.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule is a linear polyol with 6 carbons and 6 hydroxy groups. It appears to be a sugar alcohol, likely D-mannitol or D-sorbitol. 
With 6 hydroxy groups, there are limited options for further retrosynthesis in a single step while maintaining this highly hydrophilic linear structure.
Potential retrosynthetic disconnections to consider:
1) Reduction of the corresponding aldose sugar (e.g. D-glucose or D-mannose) 
2) Hydrogenation of a sugar with carbon-carbon double bonds (e.g. D-fructose)
3) Reduction of sugar lactones 
4) Partial protection of hydroxy groups followed by reduction
Given the simplicity of the target molecule, the first two options seem most promising for a single retrosynthetic step. The molecule is likely too simple to provide many other meaningful single-step precursors.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Reduction of D-glucose (O=CC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO) or D-mannose (O=CC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO) to the target molecule D-sorbitol:
Reaction: catalytic hydrogenation 
Reagents: H2, Raney Ni or Ru/C catalyst
This is a very common route to sugar alcohols from aldose sugars. High yielding and stereospecific.
Confidence score: 0.9

<thinking>
Hydrogenation of D-fructose (OCC(O)C(O)C(=O)C(O)CO) to the target D-mannitol:
Reaction: catalytic hydrogenation
Reagents: H2, Raney Ni or Ru/C catalyst 
Reduction of the ketone in fructose would give mannitol stereospecifically. A very plausible route.
Confidence score: 0.8  
</thinking>

<thinking>
Reduction of sugar lactones like D-gluconolactone or D-mannonolactone:
Reaction: metal hydride reduction (e.g. NaBH4 or LiAlH4)
This is a less common route, as the lactones would need to be prepared first. Reduction would be facile though.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule appears to be a sugar derivative, likely glucose or a similar monosaccharide, in its cyclic hemiacetal form. The key structural features are:
- A 6-membered ring containing an oxygen (pyranose form)
- A carbonyl group at position 1, forming a lactol/hemiacetal 
- Hydroxyl groups at positions 2, 3, 4
- A hydroxymethyl group at position 5
</thinking>

<thinking>
One retrosynthetic approach could be opening the hemiacetal ring to give the linear aldehyde form of the sugar. This could be achieved under acidic conditions. The resulting precursor would be an aldohexose.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Another approach is to consider functional group interconversions of the hydroxyls. For example, the hydroxyl groups could be protected as esters or ethers. Common protecting groups like acetate esters or benzyl ethers could be used. The protected precursor could then be converted to the target molecule by deprotection.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The hydroxymethyl group at position 5 could be introduced by a nucleophilic addition reaction, such as a Grignard addition or Wittig reaction, to a 5-oxo sugar precursor. The stereochemistry would need to be controlled.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Alternatively, the hydroxymethyl group could result from reduction of a carboxylic acid or ester at that position. So a possible precursor could be a uronic acid (sugar carboxylic acid) or a sugar ester.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule is a fully acetylated glucose derivative. The key retrosynthetic steps will involve removing the acetyl protecting groups to reveal the free hydroxyls.

Removing all 5 acetyl groups in one step would give glucose as a potential precursor. This could be done under basic conditions like NaOMe/MeOH or K2CO3/MeOH.

Alternatively, the anomeric acetyl could be selectively removed first under milder acidic conditions to give the tetra-acetylated glucose hemiacetal. 

The remaining acetyl groups could then be removed in a second step with base to give glucose.

Another approach could be enzymatic deacetylation using esterases, which may allow for selective anomeric deprotection.
</thinking>

<thinking>
In summary, the key retrosynthetic strategies are:

1. One-step full deacetylation under basic conditions 
2. Two-step sequence with selective anomeric deacetylation followed by removal of the other acetyls
3. Enzymatic deacetylation, potentially selective for the anomeric position

Glucose is the key precursor in all cases. The acetyl groups could be installed by reaction of glucose with acetic anhydride and an acid catalyst like H2SO4.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains four benzyl ether protecting groups on a glucose-derived core structure. A reasonable retrosynthetic approach would be to remove the benzyl groups to reveal free hydroxyl groups. This could be accomplished via hydrogenolysis using hydrogen gas and a metal catalyst like palladium on carbon.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Another possibility is to disconnect one of the benzyl ethers via a nucleophilic substitution reaction. This would require a nucleophile like a halide (Br- or I-) to displace one of the benzyl groups. The remaining benzyl ethers could then be removed in a subsequent hydrogenolysis step.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The glucose core itself could be obtained via protection of the hydroxyl groups in glucose with benzyl bromide and a base like sodium hydride. This would be a reasonable precursor if the benzyl ethers are installed all in one step.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Alternatively, the benzyl ethers could be installed sequentially via a series of protection reactions using benzyl bromide and silver oxide. This would allow more control over the protection pattern but would require more synthetic steps.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule appears to be a sugar, likely glucose based on the 6-membered ring and the hydroxyl groups. The ring has an oxygen in it, making it a pyranose sugar. 
</thinking>

<thinking>
One retrosynthetic approach could be to open the ring between the anomeric carbon and the ring oxygen. This would give an open-chain form of glucose. The open-chain form could be obtained by a simple hydrolysis reaction from the cyclic form under acidic conditions.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Another approach is to consider removing the hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) to give a simpler 5-carbon sugar. This could be done via an oxidative cleavage reaction, converting the -CH2OH to an aldehyde which could then be removed. The resulting 5-carbon sugar would be xylose.
</thinking>

<thinking>
A third possibility is to epimerize one of the stereocenters, like C2 or C4, to give a different stereoisomer of glucose, like mannose or galactose respectively. This could be achieved under basic conditions to allow equilibration to the thermodynamic product.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Removing one or more of the alcohol groups could also give simpler deoxy sugars, but this is a less likely synthetic route and the products would deviate more from glucose. Protection of the alcohols followed by selective deprotection and functionalization could be considered for more complex retrosynthetic analysis.

Another approach is to consider removing the hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) to give a simpler 5-carbon sugar. This could be done via an oxidative cleavage using a reagent like periodate. The resulting aldehyde could then be reduced to the primary alcohol.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Alternatively, we could consider removing one of the other hydroxyl groups via a deoxygenation reaction. This would give a deoxysugar. A common way to deoxygenate sugars is via a radical-mediated process using a reagent like tributyltin hydride.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Given the high degree of functionality already present in this simple glucose molecule, further retrosynthetic simplification is challenging without significantly altering the core structure. The proposed steps provide some options, but a complex total synthesis is unlikely to be necessary for such a common sugar building block which is readily available.

2024-12-26 06:17:47 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the single-step retrosynthesis analysis for the target molecule OC1O[C@H](O)[C@H](CO)[C@@H]1O:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule is a cyclic sugar alcohol, likely a pentose or hexose. It has multiple chiral centers and hydroxyl groups. Key considerations for retrosynthesis:
1. The cyclic structure could be formed via intramolecular ring closure of a linear sugar alcohol precursor. 
2. The chiral centers and stereochemistry would need to be set in the precursor or through a stereoselective reaction.
3. The primary alcohol (CH2OH) could come from reduction of an aldehyde or carboxylic acid.
4. The secondary alcohols could come from hydration of alkenes or reduction of ketones/aldehydes.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Possible precursors and reactions:
1. Linear sugar alcohol precursor with same stereochemistry and an additional OH for ring closure. Intramolecular nucleophilic substitution under acidic conditions.
2. Linear sugar precursor with a terminal aldehyde that could be reduced to CH2OH. Stereoselective aldol condensation to set stereochemistry, followed by reduction and ring closure.  
3. Monosaccharide with same stereochemistry but an additional carbon at one end (e.g. aldohexose). Oxidative cleavage (e.g. periodate) to shorten the chain, then reduction of resulting aldehyde.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The target molecule is a relatively simple cyclic polyol. The most direct retrosynthesis would be a linear sugar alcohol precursor of the same length that could undergo ring closure. The main challenge is stereoselectively forming the chiral centers. A longer monosaccharide precursor that could be cleaved to the right length is also plausible. Stereoselective aldol reactions are a possibility but seem less direct. Confidence is moderate to high for the linear precursor and chain cleavage routes, lower for the aldol.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains an aldehyde functional group at one end and multiple alcohol groups. One approach could be to disconnect the aldehyde via reduction to form a polyol. The stereochemistry of the molecule needs to be considered.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Another possibility is to disconnect one of the alcohol C-O bonds via substitution or elimination reactions. This could lead to halogenated precursors or alkene-containing molecules. Protecting group strategies may be needed for the other alcohols.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The molecule also contains vicinal diols, which could arise from dihydroxylation of an alkene precursor. The stereochemistry suggests a syn dihydroxylation. This points to an alkene precursor as another viable route.
</thinking>

<thinking>
In summary, three main retrosynthetic strategies are apparent: 1) Aldehyde reduction 2) Alcohol substitution or elimination 3) Alkene dihydroxylation. Specific precursors can be proposed based on these strategies, keeping stereochemistry and protecting groups in mind. Confidence is relatively high given the straightforward disconnections, with the exception of the stereospecific dihydroxylation.

The target molecule contains a few key functional groups to consider for retrosynthesis:
1. A primary alcohol (-CH2OH)  
2. Two secondary alcohols with defined stereochemistry
3. A primary alkyl iodide
The molecule has 3 chiral centers. Retrosynthesis will need to consider how to set the stereochemistry.

One approach could be opening of an epoxide to set the vicinal diol stereochemistry. The primary iodide and alcohol could come from substitution reactions on the other end.
Alternatively, the molecule could be formed by iodination of a chiral triol. The triol stereochemistry could be set by asymmetric dihydroxylation of a chiral allylic alcohol.
</thinking>

Another potential precursor is a protected pentose sugar, which could undergo selective deprotection and substitution to install the iodide. The stereochemistry would be defined by the chiral sugar starting material.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains an epoxide ring with a chlorine and hydroxymethyl substituent. The stereocenters are defined.

One approach would be opening of the epoxide ring. This could occur via an SN2 reaction with a nucleophile like a halide (Cl-, Br-, I-), azide (N3-), or alkoxide (RO-). The nucleophile would attack at the less hindered carbon. Stereochemistry would be inverted at that position.

Alternatively, the epoxide could be formed via closing an opened halo-alcohol. Treatment of a vicinal halohydrin with base would displace the halide and form the epoxide ring. The stereochemistry of the starting halohydrin would be retained.

The hydroxymethyl group could come from reduction of an ester or aldehyde precursor. Hydride sources like LiAlH4 or NaBH4 could accomplish this transformation.

The target is a relatively simple molecule so there are limited options for retrosynthesis. Ring-opening the epoxide or forming it from a halohydrin precursor are the most promising approaches. Reduction to install the hydroxymethyl is also very reasonable.
</thinking>

<thinking>
To summarize, the key retrosynthetic strategies are:
1. Epoxide ring-opening with a nucleophile (SN2)
2. Epoxide formation from a vicinal halohydrin 
3. Reduction of an ester or aldehyde to give the hydroxymethyl group

I have high confidence in the epoxide ring-opening and ring-closing approaches. The reduction is also a very reliable transformation. More complex precursors are unlikely to be required for this relatively simple target.

2024-12-26 06:25:18 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the single-step retrosynthesis analysis for the molecule OCC(O)C(Cl)I:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule OCC(O)C(Cl)I contains several key functional groups to consider for retrosynthesis:
- A primary alcohol (OH group on a terminal carbon)
- A secondary alcohol (OH group on an internal carbon) 
- A chloroalkane (C-Cl bond)
- An iodoalkane (C-I bond)

Potential disconnections could involve:
1) Replacing the iodine with another leaving group or nucleophile 
2) Replacing the chlorine with another leaving group or nucleophile
3) Oxidizing one of the alcohols from an aldehyde or ketone
4) Reducing one of the alcohols from an aldehyde or carboxylic acid
5) Forming one of the C-O bonds via an SN2 reaction or epoxide opening
</thinking>

<thinking>
For the first suggestion, the iodoalkane could come from an SN2 reaction between a haloalkane or tosylate and iodide anion. The precursor would be OCC(O)C(Cl)X where X is a leaving group like Cl, Br, OTs, etc.
Precursors: OCC(O)C(Cl)Cl, OCC(O)C(Cl)Br, OCC(O)C(Cl)OC(=O)C1=CC=C(C=C1)S(=O)(=O)C
Reaction: SN2 with NaI or KI
</thinking>

<thinking>
Similarly, the chloroalkane could come from an SN2 reaction between a haloalkane or tosylate and chloride anion. The precursor would be OCC(O)C(X)I where X is a leaving group.
Precursors: OCC(O)C(Br)I, OCC(O)C(OC(=O)C1=CC=C(C=C1)S(=O)(=O)C)I  
Reaction: SN2 with NaCl or KCl
</thinking>

<thinking>
One of the alcohols could be oxidized from an aldehyde using a mild reducing agent like NaBH4. The precursor would be O=CC(O)C(Cl)I or OCC(=O)C(Cl)I.
Precursors: O=CC(O)C(Cl)I, OCC(=O)C(Cl)I
Reaction: Reduction with NaBH4 or LiAlH4
</thinking>

<thinking>
The molecule is complex enough that further meaningful retrosynthetic analysis is possible. The key considerations are the halogens as potential leaving groups and the alcohols as handles for redox reactions or C-O bond formation.

2024-12-26 06:28:14 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the retrosynthetic analysis for the target molecule OCC(O)C(Cl)Br:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains a few key functional groups to consider for retrosynthesis:
1. A primary alcohol (-OH) 
2. A secondary alcohol (-OH)
3. A chlorine (-Cl) on a secondary carbon
4. A bromine (-Br) on a secondary carbon
The combination of the halogens and alcohols on adjacent carbons suggests potential routes involving halogenation of diols or hydrolysis of dihalides. I'll propose a few possibilities.
</thinking>

<thinking>
One approach could be hydrolysis of a dihalide precursor:
ClC(Br)C(Cl)Br + 2 H2O -> OCC(O)C(Cl)Br + 2 HCl 
This would be a double hydrolysis under basic conditions, selectively hydrolyzing the alkyl bromides over the alkyl chlorides due to the higher reactivity of C-Br bonds. Retrosynthetically, this suggests 1,2-dibromo-1,2-dichloroethane as a precursor.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Another route could be selective halogenation of a diol:
OCC(O)COH + HCl + HBr -> OCC(O)C(Cl)Br + 2 H2O  
The diol 1,2,3-propanetriol could be sequentially halogenated, first with HCl then with HBr. The primary alcohol would be left untouched. Reaction conditions would need to be controlled to avoid over-halogenation.
</thinking>

<thinking>
A third possibility is nucleophilic substitution on an epoxide:
OCC1OC1Br + HCl -> OCC(O)C(Cl)Br
The epoxide could be prepared from 3-bromo-1,2-propanediol. Ring opening with HCl would occur at the less hindered carbon, installing the chlorine.  
</thinking>

<thinking>
In summary, I propose three key retrosynthetic routes:
1. Double hydrolysis of 1,2-dibromo-1,2-dichloroethane 
2. Sequential halogenation of 1,2,3-propanetriol
3. Epoxide ring opening of 3-bromo-1,2-epoxypropanol
The dihalide route seems most promising as the precursor is simple and the reaction is selective. The diol route is also viable but may suffer from over-halogenation. The epoxide route is a good option if that precursor is readily available.
</thinking>

One approach could be hydrolysis of a dihalide precursor:
ClC(Br)C(Cl)Br + 2 H2O -> OCC(O)C(Cl)Br + 2 HCl 
This would be a double hydrolysis under basic conditions, selectively replacing the bromines with alcohols. The differing reactivities of Cl vs Br makes the selectivity possible. Confidence is medium-high since the reaction is straightforward but selectivity may be tricky.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Another option is selective halogenation of a diol:
OCC(O)COH + HCl + HBr -> OCC(O)C(Cl)Br + 2 H2O
This di-halogenation could be done sequentially, using stoichiometric amounts of HCl then HBr to control selectivity. Alternatively, a one-pot reaction with careful control of conditions may work. Confidence is medium - the reaction should work but optimizing selectivity may be challenging.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The molecule could also come from reduction of a halo-acid:
OCC(O)C(=O)Cl + HBr + reducing agent -> OCC(O)C(Cl)Br + H2O
The ketone-acid could be selectively reduced to the alcohol-halide using a suitable reducing agent like LiAlH4 or NaBH4. HBr would then replace the chlorine. Confidence is medium-low, as over-reduction may be hard to control.
</thinking>

<thinking>
A more complex route could involve epoxide opening:
O=C1OC1C(Cl)Br + NaBH4 -> OCC(O)C(Cl)Br
The epoxide could be regioselectively opened with hydride to give the 1,2-diol product. The halides would be pre-installed. This relies on selective epoxide opening which may be challenging. Confidence is lower due to the more complex setup.

<thinking>
The target molecule contains a few key functional groups to consider for retrosynthesis:
1. A primary alcohol (-OH) 
2. A secondary alcohol (-OH)
3. A chloroalkane (C-Cl)
4. A bromoalkane (C-Br)

The molecule has a branched structure with the two halogens on one carbon and the two alcohols on adjacent carbons. 

One approach could be to consider precursors that already contain one or both of the halogens, which could be installed via halogenation reactions. The alcohols could come from reduction of carbonyls or ring opening of epoxides.

Alternatively, we could consider precursors with the alcohol groups preinstalled, and then form the carbon-halogen bonds in the forward synthesis. The alcohols could come from a diol, with the halogens installed via an alcohol activation strategy.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Specific retrosynthetic suggestions:

1. Precursor: BrC(O)C(Cl)CO
   Form the primary alcohol via reduction of the aldehyde. The secondary alcohol could be formed via hydrolysis of the C-Br bond.

2. Precursors: OCC(O)C(=O)Cl  +  HBr 
   Form the C-Br bond via addition of HBr to the acid chloride. The secondary alcohol is preinstalled.

3. Precursor: OCC1OC1Cl
   Form both alcohols via ring opening of the epoxide. The C-Cl bond is preinstalled. Install the C-Br bond via an alcohol activation strategy.

4. Precursors: OCC(O)CCl  +  Br2
   The diol is preinstalled. Form the C-Br bond via free radical halogenation. The C-Cl bond is preinstalled.

5. Precursors: OCC(O)C=C  +  HCl  +  HBr
   Diol is preinstalled. Form both C-X bonds via electrophilic addition of the hydrogen halides to the alkene.

2024-12-26 06:31:19 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the retrosynthetic analysis for the target molecule OCC(O)C(Cl)OC(=O)C1=CC=C(C=C1)S(=O)(=O)C:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains several key functional groups to consider for retrosynthesis:
1. A sulfonyl (R-SO2-R) group attached to the benzene ring
2. An ester (R-COO-R) group linking the benzene ring to the chlorinated diol
3. A secondary chloroalkane (R2-CHCl) 
4. A 1,2-diol (HO-CH2-CH(OH)-) group

Based on these functional groups, several retrosynthetic disconnections are possible. The most promising appear to be:
1. Disconnection of the ester group back to a benzenesulfonyl chloride and the chlorinated diol 
2. Disconnection of the C-Cl bond to give an epoxide intermediate
3. Disconnection of the sulfonyl group to a thiol and subsequent oxidation
</thinking>

<thinking>
For the first retrosynthetic route, an esterification reaction between a benzenesulfonyl chloride and the chlorinated diol under basic conditions could form the target molecule. The diol could be accessed by opening of an epoxide with water under acidic conditions.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The second route involves opening of an epoxide intermediate with a chloride nucleophile. The epoxide could be formed by oxidation of the corresponding alkene diol. This alkene could be made by elimination of water from the 1,2-diol.
</thinking>

<thinking>
For the third route, the sulfonyl group could be introduced by oxidation of a thiol using a strong oxidant like H2O2. The thiol could be accessed by nucleophilic aromatic substitution of a halobenzene with a sulfur nucleophile.
</thinking>

2024-12-26 06:33:37 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the single-step retrosynthesis analysis for the molecule OCC(O)C(Cl)O:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule OCC(O)C(Cl)O contains a few key functional groups to consider for retrosynthesis:
1. Two terminal hydroxyl (-OH) groups 
2. A chlorine atom (-Cl) on one of the internal carbons
3. The molecule is a vicinal diol, with two -OH groups on adjacent carbons

Some potential retrosynthetic disconnections to consider:
- Removing the -Cl via hydrogenolysis or hydrolysis 
- Removing one or both -OH groups via reduction or deoxygenation
- Breaking the molecule into two smaller fragments by cleaving the C-C bond between the two internal carbons
</thinking>

<thinking>
Suggestion 1: Hydrogenolysis of the C-Cl bond
- This would give the precursor OCC(O)CO, removing the -Cl 
- Conditions: H2, Pd/C catalyst
- The resulting precursor is a simpler diol
- Confidence: High, as hydrogenolysis of C-Cl is a reliable reaction
</thinking>

<thinking>
Suggestion 2: Hydrolysis of the C-Cl bond 
- This would replace the -Cl with -OH, giving the precursor OCC(O)C(O)O
- Conditions: Aqueous NaOH or KOH
- Results in a triol product
- Confidence: High, as hydrolysis of C-Cl with base is a reliable reaction
</thinking>

<thinking>
Suggestion 3: Reduction of one -OH to give a chlorohydrin
- Reducing one of the terminal -OH groups gives the precursor OCC(O)CCl 
- Conditions: NaBH4 or LiAlH4 as reducing agent
- Confidence: Moderate, as over-reduction to remove -Cl is possible
</thinking>

<thinking>
Suggestion 4: Breaking the central C-C bond
- This would give two precursor fragments: a chlorohydrin ClCH(OH) and an aldehyde or its hydrate form OHC-CH2OH
- An aldol reaction could combine these fragments to form the target
- Confidence: Moderate, as aldol can give mixture of products and may require protection of -OH groups

2024-12-26 06:34:02 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the single-step retrosynthesis analysis for ClC(O):

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule ClC(O) is an acid chloride. Acid chlorides are typically synthesized from carboxylic acids using thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride. Since this is a simple molecule with only 3 atoms, there are limited meaningful retrosynthetic disconnections possible.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The most straightforward precursor would be formic acid, HC(O)OH. Treating formic acid with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) or oxalyl chloride ((COCl)2) would convert the -OH group to a -Cl, yielding the target acid chloride ClC(O). This is a very high-yielding reaction under mild conditions.
</thinking>

<thinking>
An alternative precursor could be formyl chloride, ClCHO. Oxidation of the aldehyde (CHO) group, for example using chromic acid (H2CrO4), would give the target acid chloride ClC(O). However, formyl chloride is an unstable compound and not a common synthetic building block.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The target ClC(O) is a simple molecule with limited retrosynthetic options. The carboxylic acid precursor HC(O)OH via acid chloride formation is the most plausible and high-yielding route. The aldehyde precursor ClCHO is less viable. No other meaningful precursors are apparent given the small size of the target.

2024-12-26 06:34:41 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the retrosynthesis analysis for ClC(O):

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule ClC(O) is acyl chloride. It is a relatively simple molecule with only 3 atoms. The key functional group is the C-Cl bond, which is a reactive electrophilic site. 
</thinking>

<thinking>
One retrosynthetic approach would be to consider how the C-Cl bond could have been formed. Common methods to form acyl chlorides are by chlorination of carboxylic acids using thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride. So a potential precursor is formic acid, HC(O)OH.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Another approach is to consider the C=O double bond. This could come from oxidation of an aldehyde like formaldehyde, C=O. However, selective oxidation to an acyl chloride may be challenging.
</thinking>

<thinking>
A third approach is to consider if the molecule could arise from decomposition or rearrangement of a larger precursor. However, in this case, the molecule is already quite simple, so further retrosynthetic simplification may not be very meaningful.
</thinking>

2024-12-26 06:36:24 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the single-step retrosynthesis analysis for the target molecule BrCC1OC(C(O)C(O)C1O)C(O)CO:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains a brominated alkyl group attached to a pyranose sugar ring with multiple hydroxyl groups. Key retrosynthetic disconnections to consider are:
1. Removal of the bromine to give a simpler alkyl-substituted sugar 
2. Hydrolysis of the acetal/ketal linkages in the pyranose ring to give an open-chain polyol
3. Reduction of the primary alcohol to give an aldehyde precursor
4. Protecting group strategies to mask the hydroxyl groups during synthesis
</thinking>

<thinking>
Suggestion 1: Remove the bromine via a metal-halogen exchange or reduction to give the non-halogenated precursor. This could be achieved with a metal catalyst like Pd or Ni under hydrogen atmosphere. The sugar portion would remain intact.
Precursor: OCC1OC(C(O)C(O)C1O)C(O)CO
Confidence: 0.8
</thinking>

<thinking>
Suggestion 2: Hydrolyze the pyranose ring under acidic aqueous conditions to give an open-chain polyol with an alkyl halide substituent. The multiple hydroxyl groups would need to be protected, e.g. as acetates or TBS ethers, in the precursor.
Precursor: BrCC(O)C(OAc)C(OAc)C(OAc)C(OAc)COAc 
Confidence: 0.7
</thinking>

<thinking>
Suggestion 3: Reduce the primary hydroxyl group to an aldehyde oxidation state. This could be achieved via Swern or Dess-Martin oxidation. The aldehyde precursor could then be attacked by a suitable brominated Grignard or organolithium reagent to install the bromoethyl group.
Precursor: O=CC1OC(C(O)C(O)C1O)C(O)CO
Confidence: 0.6
</thinking>

<thinking>
Suggestion 4: Protect all hydroxyl groups as ethers (e.g. benzyl or PMB) to allow selective alkylation at the primary position. The halide could then be installed via an SN2 reaction with a suitable electrophile like NBS or CBr4/PPh3.
Precursor: BnOCC1OC(C(OBn)C(OBn)C1OBn)C(OBn)COBn
Confidence: 0.5
</thinking>

2024-12-26 06:36:49 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the single-step retrosynthesis analysis for the target molecule BrCC1OC(C(O)C(O)C1O)C(O)CO:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains a brominated alkyl group attached to a pyranose sugar ring with multiple hydroxyl groups. Key retrosynthetic disconnections to consider are:
1. Removal of the bromine to give a simpler alkyl-substituted sugar 
2. Hydrolysis of the acetal/ketal linkages in the pyranose ring to give an open-chain polyol
3. Disconnection of the alkyl-oxygen bond to give an alkyl halide and a hydroxylated sugar derivative
</thinking>

<thinking>
Removing the bromine would simplify the molecule and could be achieved via hydrogenolysis or reduction. The resulting alkyl-substituted pyranose could come from glycosylation of a protected sugar derivative with a simple alkyl alcohol or alkoxide.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Hydrolysis of the pyranose ring could be achieved under acidic aqueous conditions. The resulting open-chain polyol could be formed by aldol condensation of a shorter hydroxylated aldehyde with a hydroxylated ketone, followed by reduction.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Disconnecting the ether linkage between the alkyl group and pyranose would give an alkyl halide and a free hydroxyl group on the sugar. These could be joined via Williamson ether synthesis. The alkyl halide could come from an alcohol by halogenation. The hydroxylated pyranose could be obtained by selective protection and deprotection sequences.

2024-12-26 06:37:48 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the retrosynthetic analysis for the target molecule OCC1OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C1O:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule appears to be a sugar alcohol, likely D-mannitol based on the stereochemistry. Key structural features to consider for retrosynthesis:
- The molecule is a linear chain of 6 carbons with hydroxyl groups on each carbon 
- It contains a cyclic acetal protecting group spanning carbons 1-4
- The hydroxyl groups on C2, C3, C4, and C6 are free
</thinking>

<thinking>
Approach 1: Selective protection and deprotection
One retrosynthetic approach could involve selective protection and deprotection of the hydroxyl groups. Key steps:
1. Selectively protect the 1,2-diol and 5,6-diol with an acetal protecting group 
2. Oxidize the remaining free 3,4-diol to a ketone
3. Reduce the ketone stereoselectively to give the original stereochemistry
4. Deprotect the acetals to give D-mannitol
Precursors would be D-mannitol with 1,2-diol and 5,6-diol protection. Moderate confidence in this approach.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Approach 2: Reduction of a sugar
Another potential approach is the reduction of a glucose derivative. Key steps:
1. Start with D-glucose 
2. Protect the anomeric position as a methyl glycoside
3. Reduce the aldehyde at C1 to a primary alcohol using a mild reducing agent
4. Globally deprotect to give D-mannitol
The precursor would be methyl-α-D-glucopyranoside. High confidence in this approach as it is a common route to sugar alcohols.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Approach 3: Hydrogenation of a sugar alcohol
A third approach could be catalytic hydrogenation of a related sugar alcohol. 
1. Start with an inositol stereoisomer like myo-inositol that has the correct stereochemistry 
2. Perform a catalytic hydrogenation with H2 and a catalyst like Raney Nickel to open the ring
The precursor would be myo-inositol. Moderate confidence as the stereoselectivity may be challenging to control.
</thinking>

The target molecule appears to be a sugar alcohol, likely D-mannitol based on the stereochemistry. Key structural features to consider for retrosynthesis:
- The molecule is acyclic with multiple hydroxyl groups
- There are two primary alcohol groups at the ends of the carbon chain
- The four secondary alcohols have a specific stereochemical arrangement
</thinking>

<thinking>
One approach could be reduction of a sugar aldehyde or ketone. For example, D-mannose or D-fructose could be reduced using a hydride reducing agent like NaBH4 to give D-mannitol. The sugar starting material would provide the correct stereochemistry.
Estimated SMILES: 
D-Mannose: OC[C@H]1O[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@@H]1O
D-Fructose: OC[C@H]1O[C@@](O)(CO)[C@@H](O)[C@@H]1O
Confidence: 0.8
</thinking>

<thinking>
Another option is hydrogenation of a sugar alkene. For example, D-mannono-1,4-lactone could undergo catalytic hydrogenation with H2 and a catalyst like Raney Nickel or Pd/C to reduce the alkene and lactone, giving D-mannitol. The stereochemistry would be set by the chiral starting material.
Estimated SMILES:
D-mannono-1,4-lactone: O=C1O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](O)[C@@H]1O
Confidence: 0.7  
</thinking>

<thinking>
A less likely possibility is a pinacol coupling of an aldehyde like D-glyceraldehyde. This would require very specific reaction conditions to obtain the correct stereochemistry. A chiral catalyst would likely be necessary.
Estimated SMILES:
D-glyceraldehyde: O=C[C@H](O)[C@H](O)CO
Confidence: 0.3

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule appears to be a sugar derivative, likely glucose based on the 6-membered ring and the stereochemistry of the hydroxyl groups. Key structural features to consider for retrosynthesis:

1. Hemiacetal linkage forming the pyranose ring 
2. Primary hydroxyl group at C-6
3. Secondary hydroxyl groups at C-2, C-3, C-4
4. Stereochemistry at C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5

Potential retrosynthetic disconnections:
- Opening of the pyranose ring by breaking the hemiacetal C-O bond
- Deoxygenation of one or more hydroxyl groups
- Epimerization of stereocenters, especially at the anomeric C-1 position
</thinking>

<thinking>
Suggestion 1: Ring-opening of the hemiacetal to give the open-chain form. This could be achieved under acidic aqueous conditions. The resulting product would be an aldohexose, likely D-glucose.
Precursor: OC[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)C=O
Confidence: High, as this is a common reaction for pyranose sugars.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Suggestion 2: Deoxygenation of the primary hydroxyl group at C-6 via a two-step process. First, convert the OH to a leaving group like a tosylate or halide. Then, reduce with a hydride source like LiAlH4. This would give a 6-deoxy sugar.
Precursors: OC[C@H]1O[C@@](O)(CF)[C@@H](O)[C@@H]1O (F = leaving group)
Confidence: Moderate. Deoxygenation is a known reaction, but may be challenging with other unprotected hydroxyl groups present.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Suggestion 3: Epimerization at C-1 (the anomeric carbon) under basic conditions to give the beta anomer. This could be achieved by treatment with a weak base like pyridine.  
Precursor: O[C@@H]1O[C@](CO)(O)[C@@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@@H]1O
Confidence: Moderate. Anomeric epimerization is possible, but may require protection of other hydroxyl groups.
</thinking>

<thinking>
In summary, the most promising retrosynthetic route is ring-opening to give D-glucose. Deoxygenation and epimerization are also possibilities, but may be more challenging to achieve selectively.

4. Stereochemistry at C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5 

Potential retrosynthetic disconnections:
- Opening of the pyranose ring by breaking the hemiacetal C-O bond
- Deoxygenation of one or more hydroxyl groups
- Epimerization of stereocenters, especially at the anomeric C-1 position
</thinking>

<thinking>
Retrosynthesis suggestion 1: Ring-opening of the pyranose hemiacetal. This would give an open-chain form of glucose, likely existing in equilibrium with the aldehyde. The hydroxyl stereochemistry would be retained. Reaction conditions would be acidic aqueous solution.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Retrosynthesis suggestion 2: Selective deoxygenation of the primary C-6 hydroxyl group. This could be accomplished via a Barton-McCombie deoxygenation, converting the OH to a xanthate ester followed by reduction. The remaining hydroxyl stereochemistry would be unchanged.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Retrosynthesis suggestion 3: Epimerization at the anomeric C-1 position. Treatment with a mild base like pyridine could lead to the beta-anomer via a ring-opening and closing mechanism. The remaining stereochemistry would be retained. 
</thinking>

<thinking>
An additional retrosynthetic route could involve partial protection of the hydroxyl groups, for example as acetonides or benzyl ethers, to allow for selective transformations. However, this would add additional steps.

In general, the high degree of existing oxidation and defined stereochemistry in the target glucose molecule makes retrosynthesis challenging. Many pathways would likely require enzyme-mediated processes to establish the correct stereochemistry.

2024-12-26 06:42:12 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the retrosynthetic analysis for the given molecule OC[C@H]1O[C@@](O)(CO)[C@@H](O)[C@@H]1O:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule is a cyclic sugar with multiple chiral centers and hydroxyl groups. The key considerations for retrosynthesis are:
1. Breaking the cyclic structure, likely at the acetal/ketal position
2. Addressing the stereochemistry of the chiral centers
3. Considering protection/deprotection of the hydroxyl groups
</thinking>

<thinking>
One approach is to break the molecule at the acetal position between C1 and the ring oxygen. This could be achieved via acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. The resulting precursor would be a linear sugar with an aldehyde at one end and multiple chiral alcohols.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Alternatively, the molecule could be disconnected at the C1-C2 bond via a Wittig reaction. This would give an aldehyde precursor and a Wittig reagent precursor, with the chiral alcohols still in place. Stereochemistry would need to be controlled.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Another option is to form the sugar ring via an intramolecular aldol condensation. This would disconnect the C1-C2 bond, giving an open-chain precursor with an aldehyde and a ketone, plus the remaining chiral alcohols. Stereochemistry of the alcohols and the aldol reaction would be important.
</thinking>

<thinking>
A fourth possibility is to form the ring via an intramolecular hemiacetal formation, with the open-chain precursor having an aldehyde and multiple alcohols. Protecting groups and stereochemical control would be key considerations.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains a phosphorus atom with two phenyl substituents and what appears to be a sugar moiety (likely ribose based on the stereochemistry). Key retrosynthetic disconnections to consider are:
1) Cleavage of the P-C bond to the ribose, which could be formed via a phosphorylation reaction
2) Cleavage of one of the P-C bonds to a phenyl group, which could be formed via a nucleophilic substitution
3) Cleavage of the anomeric C-O bond of the ribose, which could be formed via a glycosylation reaction
</thinking>

<thinking>
Potential precursors from disconnection 1:
- A protected ribose derivative (e.g. using benzyl or silyl ethers) 
- A phosphorylating agent with two phenyl groups, such as diphenylphosphoryl chloride
The ribose and phosphorylating agent could be coupled using standard phosphorylation conditions, e.g. a base like pyridine or triethylamine.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Potential precursors from disconnection 2:  
- The target molecule with a P-OH group instead of one P-Ph
- Phenylboronic acid or phenyllithium as an electrophile
A nucleophilic substitution could be used to displace the -OH and install the phenyl group. Suitable conditions may be Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling (for the boronic acid) or direct addition of phenyllithium at low temperature.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Potential precursors from disconnection 3:
- A ribose donor with a good anomeric leaving group (e.g. acetate, halide, trichloroacetimidate)  
- The phosphorylated phenyl acceptor (a tertiary alcohol)
Glycosylation could be achieved using Lewis acid activation (e.g. BF3 or TMSOTf) of the donor, with the acceptor alcohol acting as a nucleophile. Stereochemistry could be controlled via anchimeric assistance from a 2-O-acyl protecting group on the donor.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule appears to be a cyclic sugar, likely glucose based on the stereochemistry. The key structural features are:
- 6-membered ring containing an oxygen (pyranose form)
- 4 chiral centers with defined stereochemistry 
- 4 hydroxyl groups and 1 hydroxymethyl group
Potential retrosynthetic disconnections could target the ring oxygen, the anomeric carbon, or deoxygenation of one of the hydroxyl groups. Ring-opening reactions or glycosylation reactions with protected glucose derivatives could be promising approaches.
</thinking>

<thinking>
One retrosynthesis option is hydrolysis of the cyclic hemiacetal, opening the ring to give the open-chain form of glucose. This could be achieved under acidic aqueous conditions. The open-chain form would have an aldehyde at the anomeric position.
Precursor: OC[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)C=O
</thinking>

<thinking>
Another approach could be anomeric O-alkylation, replacing the hydroxyl group with an alkoxy group or other leaving group. This could be accomplished via an SN2 reaction with an alkyl halide or sulfonate under basic conditions with the hydroxyl groups protected. Subsequent deprotection would give the target molecule.
Precursor: PO[C@H](OP)[C@@H](OP)[C@H](OP)[C@H](OP)C[O-] + R-X (where P = protecting group, X = leaving group)
</thinking>

<thinking>
Deoxygenation of one of the hydroxyl groups via a 2-step reduction-deoxygenation sequence is another possibility. The hydroxyl group could first be converted to a good leaving group like a halide or sulfonate ester. Subsequent hydride reduction would remove the oxygen. Stereochemistry could be retained via an SN2 reduction. 
Precursor: XC[C@H]1O[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H]1O (where X = halide or sulfonate)
</thinking>

<thinking>
The target molecule could also potentially be obtained via a glycosylation reaction between a protected glucose donor and a simple hydroxyl nucleophile acceptor. Common glucose donors are glycosyl halides or trichloroacetimidates. The acceptor could be methanol or sodium methoxide. This could form the glycosidic linkage stereoselectively with inversion at the anomeric position.
Precursors: PO[C@H](OP)[C@@H](OP)[C@H](OP)[C@H](OP)C-X + MeOH or MeO[-] (where P = protecting group, X = halide or trichloroacetimidate)

The target molecule OC[C@H]1O[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H]1O appears to be a cyclic sugar, likely glucose or a glucose derivative based on the 6-membered ring and 4 chiral centers with hydroxy groups. For retrosynthesis, I will consider the following options:

1. Ring-opening of the cyclic hemiacetal to form an open-chain aldose sugar. This would be the reverse of glucose cyclization.
2. Removal of one or more hydroxy groups, which could be achieved by reduction (hydrogenolysis) or substitution reactions.
3. Epimerization at one or more chiral centers, which would lead to different sugar stereoisomers.
</thinking>

<thinking>
For option 1, ring-opening of the cyclic hemiacetal:
- The precursor would be an open-chain aldose sugar, likely D-glucose.
- SMILES: OC[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)C=O
- This reaction is the reverse of hemiacetal formation and could be achieved under acidic conditions.
</thinking>

<thinking>
For option 2, removal of hydroxy groups:
- Hydrogenolysis could be used to remove one or more hydroxy groups, replacing them with hydrogen atoms.
- Example: removal of the hydroxy group at C-2
  - Precursor SMILES: OC[C@H]1O[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H]1
- This reaction would require a metal catalyst (e.g., Pd, Pt, Ni) and hydrogen gas.
</thinking>

<thinking>
For option 3, epimerization at chiral centers:
- Epimerization could lead to different sugar stereoisomers, such as mannose or galactose.
- Example: epimerization at C-2 to form mannose
  - Precursor SMILES: OC[C@H]1O[C@@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H]1O
- Epimerization could be achieved under basic conditions or with a suitable catalyst.

2024-12-26 06:46:17 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the retrosynthetic analysis for the target molecule OC[C@H]1O[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H]1O:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule appears to be a cyclic sugar, likely glucose based on the stereochemistry. It has 5 hydroxy groups and a cyclic hemiacetal structure. For retrosynthesis, I'll consider:
1) Ring-opening reactions to give an open-chain sugar 
2) Removal of hydroxy groups
3) Simplification of the carbon backbone
</thinking>

<thinking>
One approach is a ring-opening reaction under acidic conditions. This would give an open-chain glucose molecule with an aldehyde at C1 and hydroxy groups at the other positions. The SMILES would be OC[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)C=O.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Another option is removal of hydroxy groups. This could be done via reduction, converting the hydroxy to hydrogen. For example, removing the hydroxy at C6 would give OC1O[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@@H]1O. Multiple hydroxy groups could be reduced.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The carbon backbone could potentially be simplified by cleaving between C3 and C4. This would give two 3-carbon fragments. The left fragment would be a glyceraldehyde with SMILES OC[C@H](O)C=O. The right would be a glycerol derivative OC[C@H](O)[C@H](O).
</thinking>

<thinking>
Starting from a 5-carbon precursor is also possible. For example, arabinose or xylose could be used, with an extra hydroxy group added via oxidation. Arabinose has SMILES OC[C@H]1O[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@@H]1O.

The target molecule OC[C@H](O)[C@H](O) is a simple chiral diol. It contains two chiral centers and three hydroxyl groups. Given its simplicity, there are limited meaningful retrosynthetic disconnections that can be made.

One possibility is to consider protecting group strategies. The hydroxyl groups could be protected to enable other reactions, then deprotected. However, this doesn't simplify the molecule much.

Another option is to consider oxidation state changes. The primary alcohol could be oxidized to an aldehyde or carboxylic acid. The secondary alcohols could also potentially be oxidized to ketones. However, this would require differentiating the primary and secondary alcohols.

Alternatively, we could consider the diol motif arising from dihydroxylation of an alkene. However, the target molecule is likely too simple to have originated from this type of reaction.

Overall, given the small size and simplicity of the target diol, there are no easily identified or high-yielding retrosynthetic precursors. The molecule is essentially already in its simplest form.

The target molecule OC[C@H](O)[C@H](O) is a simple chiral diol. It contains two chiral centers and three hydroxyl groups. Given its simplicity, there are limited meaningful retrosynthetic disconnections that can be made.

One approach would be to consider precursors that could be oxidized to form this diol. The most obvious precursor would be the corresponding alkene. Dihydroxylation of the alkene, likely using OsO4/NMO, would give the target diol. The stereochemistry would be set by the facial selectivity of the dihydroxylation.

Another potential precursor could be an epoxide. Opening of a chiral epoxide with water or hydroxide would give the 1,2-diol product. However, achieving the correct stereochemistry would be challenging.

Alternatively, the molecule could potentially be accessed by reduction of a chiral α-hydroxy ketone or aldehyde. But this seems less likely to be a major contributing route.

Given the simplicity of this molecule, I don't think there are any other meaningful precursors to consider. The alkene dihydroxylation seems the most plausible and confident route. The other options have challenges with stereochemistry or seem less likely.

The target molecule is a simple chiral diol with two stereocenters. It contains a primary alcohol and two secondary alcohols. The molecule is too simple to allow for many meaningful retrosynthetic disconnections. The most reasonable precursors would be obtained by simple functional group interconversions of the alcohols.
</thinking>

<thinking>
One possibility is selective protection of the primary alcohol, followed by oxidation of the secondary alcohols to ketones. The resulting ketoalcohol could then be reduced stereoselectively to give the target diol. However, this multi-step sequence doesn't fit the criteria for a single-step retrosynthesis.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Another option is to consider the diol as the product of dihydroxylation of the corresponding alkene. The alkene precursor would be but-2-ene-1,4-diol. Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation using an appropriate chiral ligand could potentially give the desired stereochemistry. However, the yield and stereoselectivity may be low for this unactivated, electron-deficient alkene substrate.

Upon further analysis, I don't believe there are any other productive single-step retrosynthetic disconnections for this simple molecule.

<thinking>
The target molecule is a phosphine oxide with two phenyl groups and a chlorine atom attached to the phosphorus. Potential disconnections to consider for retrosynthesis:

1. Disconnecting the P=O double bond to give a chlorodiphenylphosphine precursor. This could be oxidized to form the target.

2. Disconnecting one of the P-phenyl bonds to give a chlorophenylphosphine oxide precursor. This could undergo a substitution reaction with a phenyl nucleophile like phenyllithium or a phenyl Grignard reagent.

3. Disconnecting the P-Cl bond to give a diphenylphosphinic acid precursor. This could be chlorinated using a reagent like thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride.

4. Disconnecting both P-phenyl bonds to give a phosphorus oxychloride precursor. This could undergo two sequential substitution reactions with phenyl nucleophiles.

The most promising approaches seem to be:

1. Oxidation of chlorodiphenylphosphine, as this is a direct precursor. 

2. Phenylation of chlorophenylphosphine oxide, as this requires only one additional step.

3. Chlorination of diphenylphosphinic acid, as this also requires only one additional step and avoids air-sensitive P(III) intermediates.

The approach of doubly phenylating phosphorus oxychloride seems less ideal, as it requires two steps and the mono-phenylated intermediate may be difficult to isolate.

2024-12-26 06:51:38 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the single-step retrosynthesis for the molecule O=P(Cl)(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule is a phosphine oxide with two phenyl groups and a chlorine substituent on the phosphorus. Potential retrosynthetic disconnections include:

1. Cleavage of the P-Cl bond, which could arise from chlorination of a diphenylphosphine precursor. 
2. Cleavage of one of the P-phenyl bonds, which could come from a nucleophilic addition of phenyllithium or a Grignard reagent to a chlorophosphine oxide.
3. Oxidation of the phosphine to the phosphine oxide, so a diphenylchlorophosphine precursor is possible.
</thinking>

<thinking>
For option 1, the precursor would be diphenylphosphine, O=P(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1. This could be chlorinated with a reagent like thionyl chloride or N-chlorosuccinimide. Confidence is high since this is a straightforward chlorination.
</thinking>

<thinking>
For option 2, the precursors would be phenyllithium (or phenylmagnesium bromide) and phenylphosphinic chloride. The organometallic reagent would add to the P=O bond. Reasonable confidence in this route.
</thinking>

<thinking>
For option 3, diphenylchlorophosphine (P(Cl)(c1ccccc1)c1ccccc1) could be oxidized to the target using a mild oxidant like hydrogen peroxide. High confidence as phosphine oxidation is very reliable.

2024-12-26 06:53:19 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the single-step retrosynthesis analysis for ClP(=O)c1ccccc1:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule ClP(=O)c1ccccc1 contains a phosphorus(V) chloride group attached to a phenyl ring. Potential retrosynthetic disconnections to consider:

1. Cleavage of the P-Cl bond: This would give a phenylphosphonic acid or phenylphosphonate ester precursor. The P-Cl bond could be formed via chlorination of the phosphonic acid/ester.

2. Cleavage of the P-phenyl bond: This disconnection would require a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction between a phenyl nucleophile and phosphorus oxychloride (POCl3). The phenyl nucleophile could be a phenyllithium or Grignard reagent.

3. Oxidation: The P(V) oxidation state suggests an oxidation may have occurred from a P(III) precursor. Reduction of the P=O bond would give a P(III) chlorophosphine compound which could be oxidized to the target.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Based on these options, I propose the following precursors and reactions:

1. Phenylphosphonic acid (O=P(O)(O)c1ccccc1) or a phenylphosphonate ester + chlorination 
2. Phenyllithium (c1ccccc1[Li]) or phenylmagnesium bromide (c1ccccc1[Mg]Br) + POCl3, nucleophilic aromatic substitution
3. Chlorophenylphosphine (ClP(c1ccccc1)) + oxidation

The acid/ester chlorination and the oxidation routes seem most promising. The Ar-P coupling route is less likely due to the harsh conditions required for nucleophilic aromatic substitution on an unactivated aryl ring.

2024-12-26 06:56:05 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the single-step retrosynthesis analysis for P(c1ccccc1)Cl:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule P(c1ccccc1)Cl is triphenylphosphine chloride. It contains a phosphorus atom bonded to three phenyl groups and a chlorine atom. 

One retrosynthetic approach would be to break the P-Cl bond. This could be achieved by reacting triphenylphosphine (P(c1ccccc1)3) with a chlorinating agent like thionyl chloride (SOCl2). The triphenylphosphine could in turn be made by reacting phenylmagnesium bromide (BrMgc1ccccc1) with phosphorus trichloride (PCl3).

Another approach would be to break one of the P-C bonds to the phenyl groups. This P-C bond could be formed by reacting diphenylphosphinous chloride (P(c1ccccc1)2Cl) with phenyllithium (Lica1ccccc1). The diphenylphosphinous chloride could be accessed from diphenylchlorophosphine.

A third possibility is reacting diphenylphosphine (P(c1ccccc1)2H) with N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS). The diphenylphosphine could come from reducing diphenylphosphinous chloride.
</thinking>

<thinking>
In summary, the three most plausible retrosynthetic pathways are:

1. P-Cl bond formation from triphenylphosphine and SOCl2. The triphenylphosphine can come from PhMgBr + PCl3.

2. P-C bond formation from diphenylphosphinous chloride and phenyllithium. The diphenylphosphinous chloride can come from diphenylchlorophosphine.  

3. Radical chlorination of diphenylphosphine using NCS. The diphenylphosphine can come from reducing diphenylphosphinous chloride.

I have high confidence in pathways 1 and 2 based on well-precedented reactions. Pathway 3 is more speculative but still reasonable.

2024-12-26 06:56:35 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the single-step retrosynthesis analysis for P(c1ccccc1)Cl:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule P(c1ccccc1)Cl contains a phenyl group attached to a phosphorus atom, with a chlorine atom also bonded to the phosphorus. Key retrosynthetic disconnections to consider are:

1. Breaking the P-Cl bond, which could result from chlorination of a phenylphosphine precursor. 
2. Breaking the P-phenyl bond, which could result from reaction of a chlorophosphine with phenyllithium or a Grignard reagent.
3. Simultaneously forming both the P-Cl and P-phenyl bonds via reaction of PCl3 with phenyllithium or a Grignard reagent.
</thinking>

<thinking>
For option 1, the precursor would be phenylphosphine, P(c1ccccc1). This could be chlorinated using a chlorinating agent like thionyl chloride or N-chlorosuccinimide.
Confidence: 0.8. This is a reasonable retrosynthesis, as direct chlorination of a phosphine is a known reaction.
</thinking>

<thinking>
For option 2, the precursors would be chlorophosphine (PCl) and phenyllithium (c1ccccc1[Li]) or phenylmagnesium bromide (c1ccccc1[Mg]Br). The P-C bond would form via nucleophilic addition of the organometallic to the chlorophosphine.
Confidence: 0.7. Formation of the P-C bond using an organometallic reagent is plausible, but the chlorophosphine precursor is unstable, lowering the confidence somewhat.
</thinking>

<thinking>
For option 3, the precursors are phosphorus trichloride (PCl3) and two equivalents of phenyllithium or phenylmagnesium bromide. Nucleophilic addition of the organometallic to PCl3 would form both P-C bonds, with the remaining P-Cl bond left intact.
Confidence: 0.9. This is the most likely pathway, as it forms the product in a single step from stable, readily available precursors.

The target molecule is phosphorus trichloride (PCl3), a simple inorganic molecule. As an inorganic compound, traditional retrosynthetic analysis used for organic molecules is not directly applicable. However, we can still consider potential precursors or reactions that could lead to its formation.
</thinking>

<thinking>
One possible precursor is elemental phosphorus (P4) and chlorine gas (Cl2). The reaction of white phosphorus with chlorine gas can produce phosphorus trichloride. This would be a simple one-step synthesis from the elements.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Alternatively, the chlorination of phosphine (PH3) could potentially yield phosphorus trichloride. However, phosphine itself is quite reactive and not a common starting material.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Another low-yielding possibility is the reaction of phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) with a reducing agent like phosphorus (P4), which could generate some phosphorus trichloride. However, this is not an efficient route.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Given the simplicity of phosphorus trichloride and its direct synthesis from the elements, there are limited meaningful retrosynthetic pathways. The reaction of elemental phosphorus with chlorine gas remains the most straightforward route.

2024-12-26 06:57:42 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the single-step retrosynthesis analysis for [P]:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule [P] contains a phosphate group attached to an alkyl chain. Retrosynthetically, there are a few key bond disconnections that could lead to this molecule:

1. The C-O bond connecting the phosphate to the alkyl chain could be formed via an SN2 reaction between an alkyl halide and a phosphate salt. 

2. Alternatively, the same C-O bond could be formed by an alcohol reacting with POCl3, followed by hydrolysis. This would require the alcohol precursor.

3. The alkyl chain itself could be formed by a Grignard addition to an aldehyde or ketone, followed by reduction. The Grignard reagent would come from the corresponding alkyl halide.

4. The alkyl chain could also come from reduction of an alkene, which itself could come from dehydration of an alcohol.

5. Lastly, the phosphate group could come from phosphorylation of a phosphite salt, which could be made from PCl3.
</thinking>

<thinking>
In terms of reagents and conditions:

1. The SN2 reaction would require a strong base like NaH to form the phosphate anion nucleophile. The reaction would occur in a polar aprotic solvent like DMF or DMSO.

2. The POCl3 reaction would need to occur in the presence of a base like triethylamine or pyridine. Aqueous workup would provide the phosphate.

3. Grignard formation would require anhydrous ether as solvent and an alkyl halide. The addition to the carbonyl would likely need to be done at cold temperature. A reducing agent like LiAlH4 or NaBH4 would be needed.

4. Alkene reduction could be accomplished with H2 gas and a metal catalyst like Pd or Pt. Alternatively, a dissolving metal reduction with Na or Li in liquid ammonia could work. The alcohol dehydration would require an acid catalyst like H2SO4 or H3PO4 and heat.

5. Phosphite formation from PCl3 would require a controlled amount of water or NaOH. Oxidation to the phosphate could be done with many oxidants like Br2, H2O2, etc.

The target molecule is trisodium phosphate, Na3PO4. This is an inorganic salt, not an organic molecule. Retrosynthesis is typically applied to organic molecules to determine how they can be synthesized from simpler precursors. Since this is an ionic salt, a retrosynthetic analysis is not particularly meaningful or applicable.

The phosphate anion could come from phosphoric acid, H3PO4, by deprotonation with a strong base like NaOH. The sodium cations are spectator ions from the NaOH. 

Alternatively, it could be formed by the oxidation of phosphite salts or by combining a soluble sodium salt like NaCl with a soluble phosphate salt. However, these are not really "retrosynthetic" steps since we are dealing with an inorganic ionic compound, not an organic molecule that can be disconnected into simpler organic precursors.

Given the inorganic nature of the target molecule, a detailed retrosynthetic analysis is not appropriate. The problem statement is best addressed by a simple explanation clarifying this.

The target molecule O.[Na].[Na].[Na] is simply sodium oxide (Na2O) with three separate sodium atoms. This is an ionic compound consisting of the oxide anion (O2-) and sodium cations (Na+). Retrosynthesis is not particularly meaningful for such a simple inorganic salt.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Sodium oxide could potentially be formed by the direct reaction of sodium metal with oxygen gas. The reaction would be highly exothermic. No complex precursors or reagents are required.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Alternatively, sodium oxide might be produced by decomposition of sodium peroxide (Na2O2) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH). However, these are not true precursors since they are more complex than the target molecule itself.
</thinking>

<thinking>
In summary, the target molecule is too simple for a meaningful multistep retrosynthesis. Direct combination of the elements is the most plausible formation reaction. Providing multiple precursor suggestions or a detailed retrosynthetic analysis is not warranted in this case.

The given molecule is O.[Na].[Na].[Na], which represents sodium oxide (Na2O) with an extra sodium atom. This is an ionic compound consisting of the oxide anion (O2-) and sodium cations (Na+).

Retrosynthesis is typically applied to covalent organic molecules, not simple ionic compounds. Ionic compounds are usually formed by the transfer of electrons between elements, resulting in the formation of anions and cations that are held together by electrostatic forces.

In this case, the target molecule is too simple for a meaningful retrosynthesis. It would be more appropriate to consider the formation of sodium oxide from its constituent elements, sodium and oxygen, under suitable conditions.

The target molecule is molecular chlorine, Cl2. This is a very simple molecule consisting of just two chlorine atoms bonded together. There are no complex functional groups or carbon skeleton to consider.

Molecular chlorine is an elemental molecule, meaning it is not typically formed via chemical synthesis from precursor molecules. It is usually produced by industrial processes like the chloralkali process which involves electrolysis of brine (NaCl solution).

Given the simplicity of the molecule and the fact that it is an element, there are no meaningful single-step retrosynthesis suggestions in the traditional sense. The molecule is essentially already as simple as it can be from a synthetic organic chemistry perspective.

The target molecule Cl-Cl is molecular chlorine. It is a simple diatomic molecule composed of two chlorine atoms bonded together. There are no obvious retrosynthetic disconnections that can be made.

Molecular chlorine is typically produced industrially by the electrolysis of brine (aqueous sodium chloride). The chloride anions are oxidized at the anode to generate chlorine gas:

2 Cl- -> Cl2 + 2e-

Alternatively, the chlorine could come from the decomposition of compounds like bleach (sodium hypochlorite) or hydrochloric acid. However, these are not really viable precursors since the chlorine still ultimately comes from the industrial electrolytic process in their production.

Given the simplicity of the Cl2 molecule, there are no meaningful retrosynthetic suggestions that can be made. The molecule is already as simple as it gets from a synthetic organic chemistry perspective.

<cot>

The target molecule c1ccccc1[Li] is phenyllithium. It contains a phenyl ring (c1ccccc1) with a lithium atom attached. Phenyllithium is a simple organometallic reagent commonly used for nucleophilic addition reactions.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The most straightforward retrosynthesis would be the direct metalation of benzene using an organolithium base like n-butyllithium. This is a common way to prepare phenyllithium.
Reaction: c1ccccc1 + C4H9Li -> c1ccccc1[Li] + C4H10 
Conditions: Anhydrous ether solvent, cryogenic temperatures (-78°C)
</thinking>

<thinking>
An alternative could be lithium-halogen exchange from bromobenzene or chlorobenzene using n-butyllithium or t-butyllithium.
Reaction: c1ccccc1Br + C4H9Li -> c1ccccc1[Li] + C4H9Br
Conditions: Anhydrous ether solvent, low temperatures (-100°C to -78°C)

Since the molecule is already quite simple, there are no obvious complex precursors. The benzene ring cannot be easily simplified further. Retrosynthetic analysis is therefore limited for this molecule.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule CC(C)C[Li] is an organolithium compound. The key retrosynthetic step will be to replace the lithium with another group. Possible precursors could include:

1. The corresponding alkyl halide CC(C)CBr or CC(C)CI, which could undergo lithium-halogen exchange with an organolithium reagent like n-butyllithium. 

2. The corresponding alkene CC(C)C=C, which could be deprotonated at the allylic position by a strong base like n-butyllithium.

3. The corresponding terminal alkyne CC(C)C#C, which could be deprotonated by a strong base like n-butyllithium to give the lithium acetylide.

I have high confidence in the alkyl halide and alkene routes, as those are well precedented reactions for forming organolithiums. The alkyne route is plausible but less commonly used. I don't think the molecule is too simple for retrosynthesis as there are multiple viable precursors.

The target molecule CC(C)C[Li] is an organolithium compound, specifically an alkyllithium. Alkyllithiums are typically formed by the reaction of an alkyl halide with lithium metal. The carbon-lithium bond is highly polar and reactive.
</thinking>

<thinking>
One retrosynthetic approach would be to consider what alkyl halide could be used to form this organolithium. The precursor would be the corresponding alkyl chloride, bromide or iodide. Iodides are most commonly used due to their higher reactivity. So a likely precursor is CC(C)CI (isobutyl iodide).
</thinking>

<thinking>
Alternatively, the alkyllithium could be formed by lithium-halogen exchange from the corresponding alkyl bromide or iodide using an alkyllithium like n-butyllithium. The alkyl halide precursor would again be CC(C)CI.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Another possibility is deprotonation of the corresponding alkane (isobutane, CC(C)C) using a strong base like n-butyllithium. However, this is less commonly used than the alkyl halide routes, as overreaction can occur.  
</thinking>

<thinking>
In summary, the most likely retrosynthetic precursor is CC(C)CI (isobutyl iodide), either by direct reaction with lithium metal or by lithium-halogen exchange with an alkyllithium reagent. Deprotonation of isobutane is a less likely route.

2024-12-26 07:06:51 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the retrosynthetic analysis for the molecule CC(C)C[Li]:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule CC(C)C[Li] is an organolithium compound. The key retrosynthetic step will be to replace the carbon-lithium bond with a different functional group. Some options to consider:

1. Halogen-lithium exchange from the corresponding alkyl halide CC(C)C[X] (X = Cl, Br, I). This would be a common way to make an organolithium.

2. Deprotonation of the corresponding alkane CC(C)C using a strong base like n-butyllithium or t-butyllithium. The isobutyl group is not very acidic though.

3. Transmetallation from a different organometallic like a Grignard reagent CC(C)CMgX. Seems less likely than halogen-lithium exchange.

4. This is already a very simple molecule so not many other reasonable retrosynthetic options. An alkyl lithium like this would usually come from the corresponding alkyl halide.
</thinking>

<thinking>
In summary, the most plausible retrosynthetic precursor is the alkyl halide CC(C)C[X], especially where X = Br or I. Halogen-lithium exchange with n-butyllithium or t-butyllithium would be a very common way to make this type of organolithium. Deprotonation of isobutane is possible in principle but a less likely route. Transmetallation from the Grignard is also possible but halogen-lithium exchange is more typical.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule is isobutyllithium, an organolithium reagent. The key retrosynthetic step is to consider how the carbon-lithium bond could have been formed. Typical ways to make organolithium reagents are:

1. Halogen-lithium exchange from the corresponding alkyl halide 
2. Deprotonation of the corresponding alkane using a strong base like butyllithium or sec-butyllithium
3. Direct insertion of lithium metal into the corresponding alkyl halide

The alkyl halide precursor would be isobutyl bromide or isobutyl chloride. The alkane precursor would be isobutane.
</thinking>

<thinking>
In terms of reagents and conditions:

1. For halogen-lithium exchange, the alkyl halide would be treated with t-butyllithium or n-butyllithium in an ethereal solvent like diethyl ether or THF at low temperature (-78°C).

2. For deprotonation, isobutane gas would be bubbled through a solution of n-butyllithium or sec-butyllithium in hexane at room temperature. 

3. For direct insertion, lithium metal could be added to the alkyl halide in a hydrocarbon solvent with heating and mechanical activation.

Of these, halogen-lithium exchange is the most common and reliable method. Deprotonation only works well for very activated C-H bonds. Direct insertion is not used much in modern synthesis.

1. Cleavage of the O-O bond to form two hydroxyl radicals (HO•). This would require a radical initiator.
2. Reduction of H2O2 to form water (H2O). This could be achieved with various reducing agents.
3. Oxidation of water (H2O) to form H2O2. This would require a strong oxidizing agent.

Given the simplicity of the molecule, there are limited meaningful retrosynthetic routes. The most plausible precursor is water, either by oxidation to form H2O2 or as a byproduct of reducing H2O2. Radical pathways are less likely to be used in practice.
</thinking>

<thinking>
In summary, the key retrosynthetic routes are:
1. Oxidation of water with a strong oxidizing agent 
2. Reduction of H2O2 to water using a reducing agent
3. Radical cleavage of the O-O bond to form hydroxyl radicals (less likely)

I have high confidence in the oxidation and reduction routes, but lower confidence in the radical route being used in practice due to the high reactivity of radicals.

<thinking>
The target molecule is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). It is a very simple molecule consisting of an oxygen-oxygen single bond with a hydrogen atom bonded to each oxygen.

Given the simplicity of the molecule, there are limited meaningful retrosynthetic disconnections that can be made. The most straightforward precursor would be two molecules of water (H2O), which could be oxidatively coupled to form the O-O bond. 

Another possibility is the reduction of molecular oxygen (O2), but this is less likely and would require a very strong reducing agent.

Overall, given the simple nature of H2O2, a single-step retrosynthesis does not provide much insight. The molecule is more likely to be used as an oxidizing reagent itself rather than being a target for synthesis.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule is phenyllithium, an organolithium reagent. It consists of a phenyl ring (c1ccccc1) with a lithium atom attached. Phenyllithium is typically made by a halogen-metal exchange reaction between a halobenzene and an alkyllithium reagent like n-butyllithium.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The most straightforward retrosynthesis would be to disconnect the C-Li bond, giving a halobenzene precursor. The three common halobenzenes that could be used are chlorobenzene, bromobenzene, and iodobenzene. Iodobenzene would give the fastest halogen-metal exchange. An alkyllithium reagent like n-BuLi would be needed.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Alternatively, phenyllithium could potentially be accessed by direct metallation of benzene using a strong base. Benzene is more readily available than halobenzenes. However, direct metallation is usually harsher, less efficient, and less commonly used than halogen-metal exchange. A very strong base like sec-BuLi/TMEDA would likely be required.

</thinking>

<thinking>
The most straightforward retrosynthesis would be to disconnect the carbon-lithium bond, replacing the lithium with a halogen like Br or I. This would give halobenzene precursors like bromobenzene or iodobenzene, which could be converted to phenyllithium by reaction with n-butyllithium or t-butyllithium.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Alternatively, the phenyl ring could be disconnected through a benzyne intermediate. Treating halobenzenes like chlorobenzene or fluorobenzene with a strong base can eliminate HX to form benzyne, which could be trapped with an organolithium to form phenyllithium. However, this pathway is less likely than the simple halogen-metal exchange.
</thinking>

<thinking>
A third lower-yielding possibility would be to deprotonate benzene with a very strong base like n-butyllithium. The pKa of benzene is very high (>40), so this is not an ideal approach. Benzene is not a great precursor here.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains an aldehyde functional group, three secondary alcohols, and a primary alcohol. Potential retrosynthetic disconnections include:
1) Oxidation of the primary alcohol to form the aldehyde 
2) Reduction of the aldehyde to a primary alcohol
3) Protecting group chemistry on the alcohols
4) Functional group interconversion of the alcohols
5) Carbon-carbon bond forming reactions to construct the carbon backbone
</thinking>

<thinking>
Disconnection of the aldehyde by reduction would give the tetraol precursor molecule. This could be accomplished using a reducing agent like NaBH4. The tetraol could potentially be accessed from a protected tetraol, with the alcohols protected as ethers or esters. The linear tetraol could arise from a ring-opening of a furanose sugar derivative.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The target contains multiple stereocenters. The relative and absolute stereochemistry would need to be set using chiral reagents or auxiliaries, or by starting with a chiral pool precursor. The linear polyol structure suggests potential carbohydrate precursors as a source of the stereochemistry.
</thinking>

<thinking>
In summary, the key strategic considerations are:
- Oxidation state of the terminal carbon (alcohol vs aldehyde) 
- Protecting groups for alcohols
- Stereochemistry of the 3 secondary alcohols
- Potential to form carbon backbone via C-C bond formation
- Carbohydrates as a potential source of the polyol stereochemistry

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains a phosphate group connected to a polyhydroxylated carbon chain. The key bond disconnections to consider are:
1) The C-O bond connecting the phosphate to the carbon chain. This could be formed via a phosphorylation reaction.  
2) The C-C bonds in the carbon chain. These could be formed via aldol condensation or nucleophilic addition reactions.
3) The C-O bonds to the hydroxyl groups. These could be installed via epoxidation/hydrolysis, or dihydroxylation reactions.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Disconnecting the C-O bond to the phosphate group would give a polyhydroxylated alcohol precursor. The phosphate could be installed by reaction with a phosphorylating agent like POCl3.
Precursor: OC[C@@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)CO
Reaction: Phosphorylation

The carbon chain could be disconnected into two aldehyde fragments via a retroaldol reaction. An aldol condensation of these two fragments under basic conditions could form the target.
Precursors: OCC(O)C(O)C=O and O=CCO
Reaction: Aldol condensation
</thinking>

<thinking>
Alternatively, the carbon chain could be formed by nucleophilic addition of a metallated alkoxide to a protected aldehyde or epoxide, followed by deprotection. 
Precursors: OCC(O)C(O)CBr and OCHCHO (protected)

2024-12-26 07:14:41 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the single-step retrosynthesis analysis for the molecule OCC(O)C(O)C=O:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule OCC(O)C(O)C=O contains an aldehyde functional group (C=O) and three alcohol groups (OH). Potential retrosynthetic disconnections include:

1. Oxidation of the primary alcohol to form the aldehyde. The precursor would be a tetraol.
2. Reduction of the aldehyde to a primary alcohol. The precursor would be a tetraol. 
3. Aldol condensation to form the β-hydroxyaldehyde. This would involve an enolate precursor and formaldehyde.
4. Nucleophilic addition of an organometallic reagent (e.g. Grignard) to a protected hydroxyaldehyde to install the alcohol groups.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde could be achieved using PCC or Swern oxidation. The precursor molecule would be OCC(O)C(O)CO, a tetraol.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Reduction of the aldehyde to a primary alcohol could be done with NaBH4 or LiAlH4. Again, the precursor would be the tetraol OCC(O)C(O)CO.
</thinking>

<thinking>
An aldol condensation between an enolate such as lithiated ethyl acetate (CCO[C:1]([O-])=O) and formaldehyde (C=O) could produce the β-hydroxyaldehyde after workup and deprotection. The enolate would be formed by treating ethyl acetate with LDA at low temperature.
</thinking>

<thinking>
A Grignard addition to a protected hydroxyaldehyde like O=CC(O[Pg])CO[Pg] ([Pg] = protecting group) with excess methylmagnesium bromide would give the tetraol after aqueous workup and deprotection. Suitable alcohol protecting groups would be ethers like MOM or SEM that are stable to Grignard conditions but easily removed later.

2024-12-26 07:15:48 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the single-step retrosynthesis for the molecule CCO[C:1]([O-])=O:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule is ethyl acetate, an ester. The key retrosynthetic disconnection would be to break the ester C-O bond, which could be formed via an esterification reaction between an alcohol and a carboxylic acid or acid derivative.

Possible precursors are:
1. Ethanol + acetic acid (Fischer esterification)
2. Ethanol + acetyl chloride (acid chloride esterification) 
3. Ethanol + acetic anhydride (anhydride esterification)
4. Ethoxide + acetyl chloride (Williamson ether synthesis-like reaction)

The alcohol component will always be ethanol. The carboxylic acid component could be acetic acid, acetyl chloride, or acetic anhydride depending on the specific esterification conditions used.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Ethanol has the SMILES CCO. 
Acetic acid has the SMILES CC(=O)O.
Acetyl chloride has the SMILES CC(=O)Cl. 
Acetic anhydride has the SMILES CC(=O)OC(C)=O.
Ethoxide anion has the SMILES CCO[H].
</thinking>

<thinking>
In summary, the key retrosynthetic step is esterification, with ethanol as the alcohol component and either acetic acid, acetyl chloride, or acetic anhydride as the carboxylic acid component. An ethoxide anion could also be used with acetyl chloride.

The Fischer esterification is the simplest method but requires acid catalyst and heat. The other methods are faster but require harsher reagents. The Williamson-like reaction requires a strong base to form the alkoxide.

I'm quite confident in these retrosynthetic suggestions as they represent the most common ways to make this simple ester.
</thinking>

2024-12-26 07:16:46 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the retrosynthetic analysis for the target molecule BrCCBr:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule 1,2-dibromoethane (BrCCBr) is a simple alkyl halide. Potential retrosynthetic disconnections to consider:
1. Halogenation of an alkene (addition of Br2 to ethene) 
2. Halogenation of an alcohol (converting ethylene glycol to the dibromide)
3. Alkylation using an alkyl halide electrophile (e.g. 2 equiv. of bromoethane)
The first two options seem most promising and straightforward. The third option is less likely.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Evaluating the potential precursors:
1. Ethene (C=C) plus Br2 is a very plausible precursor pair. The electrophilic addition of Br2 to the double bond would yield the 1,2-dibromoethane product. This is a common undergraduate organic chemistry transformation.
2. Ethylene glycol (OCCO) is a plausible precursor. Treatment with a brominating agent like PBr3 would convert the alcohol groups to bromides.
3. Using 2 equiv. of bromoethane (CCBr) is possible in theory, but forming the C-C bond seems less likely than the other options which take advantage of the existing C-C connectivity in the precursors. 
</thinking>

<thinking>
In summary, the two most plausible retrosynthetic pathways are:
1. Bromination of ethene with Br2 
2. Conversion of ethylene glycol to the dibromide using PBr3 or a similar reagent
The bromination of ethene feels the most likely and straightforward, so it will be given the highest confidence score. The ethylene glycol route is also viable but perhaps slightly less obvious.

2024-12-26 07:17:20 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the retrosynthetic analysis for 1,2-dibromoethane:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule 1,2-dibromoethane is a simple alkyl halide with two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons. Potential retrosynthetic disconnections to consider:

1. Disconnection of one C-Br bond to give bromoethene and HBr. This suggests an addition reaction of HBr to an alkene.

2. Disconnection of both C-Br bonds to give ethene. This suggests a double addition of Br2 to an alkene. 

3. Disconnection of the C-C bond to give bromomethane. This suggests an SN2 reaction between two equivalents of bromomethane.

The double addition of Br2 to ethene and the SN2 reaction between bromomethane seem like the most plausible and direct routes. The HBr addition is less likely since both bromines need to be installed.

To form 1,2-dibromoethane from ethene:
- React ethene with Br2 
- The mechanism is electrophilic addition, with Br2 as the electrophile
- Anti addition of Br2 across the double bond
- Occurs in a single step, no other reagents needed
</thinking>

<thinking>
To form 1,2-dibromoethane from 2 equivalents of bromomethane: 
- React 2 equivalents of bromomethane under SN2 conditions
- One bromomethane acts as the nucleophile, the other as the electrophile
- Results in C-C bond formation and installation of both bromines
- Requires a strong base like NaH or NaNH2 to generate the carbanion nucleophile
</thinking>

<thinking>
In summary, the two most plausible retrosynthetic pathways are:
1. Double addition of Br2 to ethene 
2. SN2 reaction between 2 equivalents of bromomethane

The Br2 addition is a single step reaction with no additional reagents, while the SN2 requires strongly basic conditions. 
The Br2 addition is therefore the preferred pathway.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule CBr is very simple, consisting of just a carbon atom bonded to a bromine atom. There are limited meaningful retrosynthetic disconnections that can be made:

1. We could consider the C-Br bond and disconnecting it. This would give us a carbocation (C+) and a bromide anion (Br-). However, this is not a practical or useful retrosynthesis.

2. Alternatively, we could think about how to install the C-Br bond. One option would be an SN2 reaction between a nucleophilic carbon species like a Grignard reagent or organolithium and a bromine electrophile like Br2 or NBS. However, this would require the carbon nucleophile to be extremely simple like MeMgBr or MeLi, which are not meaningful precursors.

3. Another option to form the C-Br bond could be a radical reaction, e.g. between a carbon-centered radical and Br2. But again, the carbon radical would have to be very simple (essentially just a methyl radical •CH3) to lead to the target.

Overall, while we can think of some hypothetical reactions, they all require an extremely simple carbon precursor that is not a meaningful synthetic target itself. The target molecule CBr is really too simple to propose useful retrosynthetic precursors for.

The target molecule is very simple, consisting of just a carbon atom bonded to a bromine atom. This is bromomethane, also known as methyl bromide. Given the simplicity of the molecule, there are limited meaningful retrosynthetic disconnections that can be made.

One possibility is to consider the carbon-bromine bond and how it could have been formed. The most straightforward method would be an SN2 reaction between a methyl anion equivalent and a bromine source. However, given the lack of complexity in the target molecule, proposing multiple precursors or reactions is not particularly meaningful or instructive.

Therefore, I will provide a single JSON object noting that the molecule is too simple for multiple meaningful retrosynthetic suggestions, rather than forcing several low-quality suggestions.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains a cyclohexane ring fused to a 1,3-dioxolane ring, with two hydroxymethyl groups and one hydroxyethyl group attached. Potential disconnections include:

1. Cleaving the 1,3-dioxolane ring to give a diol and a cyclohexanone precursor. This could be formed via an acetal formation reaction.

2. Disconnecting one of the hydroxymethyl groups. This suggests a precursor without that -CH2OH group, which could be added via a hydroxymethylation reaction. 

3. Disconnecting the hydroxyethyl group to give an aldehyde precursor. The hydroxyethyl group could be introduced via a Grignard addition.

4. Disconnecting the bond between the cyclohexane and 1,3-dioxolane rings. This implies an intermolecular acetal formation between a diol and a cyclohexanone precursor.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Based on these key disconnections, I propose the following precursors and reactions, in decreasing order of preference:

1. Acetal formation between (2R,4S)-pentane-1,2,4,5-tetraol and cyclohexanone, using an acid catalyst. High confidence as it forms the key 1,3-dioxolane ring.

2. Hydroxymethylation of OC(CO)C1OC2(CCCCC2)OC1CCO using formaldehyde and a suitable base. Moderate confidence, as the reaction could have selectivity issues.

3. Grignard addition of methylmagnesium bromide to OC(CO)C1OC2(CCCCC2)OC1C(=O). Moderate confidence due to potential side reactions.

4. Intermolecular acetal formation between (2R,4S)-pentane-1,2,4,5-tetraol and cyclohexanone. Lower confidence, as intermolecular reactions are generally less favored.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule is a polyol with 6 carbons and 5 hydroxy groups. It has a symmetric structure with a 2-carbon hydroxyethyl group on either end of a 2-carbon 1,2-diol core.

One approach would be to disconnect one of the hydroxyethyl groups via reduction of an ester or lactone precursor. The remaining tetraol could come from epoxidation and hydrolysis of a hex-2-ene-1,6-diol.

Alternatively, the molecule could be formed by double hydroxylation of a 1,2,5,6-hexanetetrol, which could come from reduction of a glucose derivative. 

Disconnection of the central C-C bond via an aldol condensation is another possibility. This would give two 1,2,3-propanetriol units that could be derived from glycerol.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Specific retrosynthetic suggestions:

1. Reduction of a 6-hydroxy-3,4-dihydroxytetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-carboxylic acid or ester, obtained from oxidation and lactonization of hex-2-ene-1,6-diol. 

SMILES: OC(CO)C1OC(O)C(O)C1O

2. Hydrolysis of a 2-(2,3-dihydroxypropoxy)-3,4-dihydroxytetrahydrofuran, obtained from epoxidation and ring-opening of hex-2-ene-1,6-diol.

SMILES: OCC(O)COC1OC(O)C(O)C1O

3. Double hydroxylation of 1,2,5,6-hexanetetrol, obtained by reduction of a glucose derivative like monoacetone glucose.

SMILES: OCC(O)CC(O)C(O)CO

4. Aldol condensation of two glyceraldehyde molecules followed by global reduction. Glyceraldehyde can be obtained from glycerol by careful oxidation.

SMILES: OCC(O)C=O.OCC(O)C=O

1. Reduction of a 6-hydroxy lactone 
2. Epoxidation/hydrolysis of a hex-2-ene-1,6-diol
3. Double hydroxylation of 1,2,5,6-hexanetetrol from glucose
4. Aldol condensation of two glyceraldehyde units from glycerol

The lactone and epoxide pathways seem most promising and direct. The glucose and glycerol routes are more speculative and lower yielding. I'm fairly confident viable routes exist but unsure of the specifics without further literature study.

2024-12-26 07:21:44 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the single-step retrosynthesis analysis for the molecule OC(CO)C(O)C(O)CO:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule OC(CO)C(O)C(O)CO is a linear polyol with 6 carbons and 5 hydroxy groups. It has a plane of symmetry. The retrosynthesis will focus on forming the carbon-carbon bonds.
</thinking>

<thinking>
One approach is a Grignard reaction between a protected hydroxyaldehyde and a protected hydroxyalkyl halide. This forms a new C-C bond and the resulting secondary alcohol. Protecting groups like TBS ethers can be used and removed later. For example:
BrCC(O[Pr])CO[Pr] + [Pr]OC(CO[Pr])C(=O)MgBr -> [Pr]OC(CO[Pr])C(O[Pr])C(O)CO[Pr]  
(where [Pr] is a protecting group)
</thinking>

<thinking>
Alternatively, an aldol condensation could be used to form the C-C bond between two protected hydroxyaldehydes. A base like NaOH or LDA would form the enolate of one aldehyde to attack the other. For example:  
[Pr]OC(CO[Pr])C(=O) + [Pr]OC(CO[Pr])C(=O) ->[B] [Pr]OC(CO[Pr])C(O[Pr])C(O)CO[Pr]
The resulting β-hydroxyaldehyde could then be reduced to the 1,3-diol.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The Wittig reaction is another possibility, reacting a protected hydroxyalkyl triphenylphosphonium ylide with a protected hydroxyaldehyde:
Ph3P=CC(O[Pr])CO[Pr] + [Pr]OC(CO[Pr])C(=O) -> [Pr]OC(CO[Pr])C(=C)C(O[Pr])CO[Pr]
Hydrogenation would then give the saturated diol product.
</thinking>

<thinking>
A Baylis-Hillman reaction between a protected hydroxyacrylate and formaldehyde, catalyzed by DABCO, could also work:
[Pr]OC(CO[Pr])C(=O)OMe + CH2O ->[DABCO] [Pr]OC(CO[Pr])C(O)C(=C)OMe 
This product could then be hydrogenated and reduced with LiAlH4 to give the triol.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule [Pr]OCC(O)CBr contains a few key functional groups to consider for retrosynthesis:
1. A propyl ether (-O[Pr])
2. A primary alcohol (-OH)  
3. A primary alkyl bromide (-CBr)

One approach is to consider how the carbon-oxygen bonds could have been formed. The ether C-O bond likely came from an O-alkylation reaction between a propoxide or propanol and an alkyl halide or tosylate. The alcohol C-O bond could come from reduction of an aldehyde/ketone, or hydrolysis of an epoxide.

Another approach is to consider precursors that would give the alkyl bromide. This could come from direct bromination of the alcohol using PBr3 or CBr4/PPh3. Or it could come from bromination of an alkene.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Based on those initial considerations, here are some specific retrosynthetic suggestions:

1. [Pr]OCC(=O)CBr, formed by oxidation of the alcohol to an aldehyde. The aldehyde precursor could be made by O-alkylation of propanol with a bromoketone or acyl halide.

2. [Pr]OC/C=C\Br, formed by dehydration of the alcohol to an alkene. The alkene precursor could be made by O-alkylation of propanol with an alkenyl halide. 

3. [Pr]OCC(O)CI, formed by conversion of the alkyl bromide to an alkyl iodide. The iodide precursor could be made by O-alkylation of the alcohol with an alkyl iodide.

4. [Pr]OCC1CO1, formed by intramolecular epoxide formation from the bromohydrin. The epoxide precursor could be made by O-alkylation of propanol with an epoxyalkyl halide.

5. [Pr]OCCHO + CH2Br2, formed by retro-aldol reaction to give propyl glycolaldehyde and dibromomethane. The glycolaldehyde precursor could be made by O-alkylation of propanol with bromoacetaldehyde.

The target molecule [Pr]OCC(O)CBr contains a few key functional groups to consider for retrosynthesis:
1. A propyl ether (-O[Pr])
2. A primary alcohol (-OH)  
3. A primary alkyl bromide (-CBr)

One approach could be to form the ether linkage via a Williamson ether synthesis, using a propoxide nucleophile and a bifunctional electrophile containing the alcohol and bromide.

Alternatively, the alcohol could be formed by reduction of an ester or aldehyde precursor. The bromide could be installed by direct bromination of the corresponding alkyl alcohol.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Possible precursors and reactions:

1. Propoxide (SMILES: [Pr]O) + BrCC(O)CBr, Williamson ether synthesis 
2. [Pr]OCC(=O)CBr ester reduction using LiAlH4 or NaBH4
3. [Pr]OCC(O)COH alcohol bromination with PBr3 or CBr4/PPh3
4. [Pr]OCC#C + H2O, acetylide hydration to form alcohol, then bromination
</thinking>

<thinking>
The Williamson ether synthesis approach seems most promising, as the other precursors would require additional steps. The ester reduction and bromination approach is also reasonable.

The acetylide hydration route is less likely to be the most efficient single step, as it requires two transformations.

The target molecule [Pr]O is propyl alcohol, a simple alcohol. Retrosynthetic analysis will focus on the C-O bond formation.

One approach is reduction of the corresponding aldehyde or ketone. Propionaldehyde ([Pr]C=O) could be reduced using a hydride reducing agent like NaBH4 or LiAlH4 to form propyl alcohol.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Alternatively, propyl alcohol could be formed by nucleophilic addition of a propyl organometallic reagent like propylmagnesium bromide to formaldehyde (C=O). The resulting alkoxide would be protonated on workup to give the alcohol.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Hydration of propene ([Pr]) using acid catalysis (H2SO4, H3PO4, etc.) and water would also produce propyl alcohol, with Markovnikov regioselectivity. 
</thinking>

Finally, substitution of a propyl halide or tosylate ([Pr]X) with hydroxide (NaOH or KOH) under SN2 conditions would displace the leaving group to form propyl alcohol. However, this is a less attractive approach.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule [Pr] is propane, a simple alkane with the formula C3H8. It is a small, saturated hydrocarbon.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Propane is too simple of a molecule for a meaningful retrosynthesis. It would not typically be a synthetic target, as it is an abundant component of natural gas that is isolated directly from petroleum. Propane serves as a starting material for other syntheses rather than being a synthetic target itself.
</thinking>

<thinking>
If a retrosynthesis was absolutely required, the most straightforward precursor would be a propyl halide like 1-bromopropane or 1-chloropropane. These could undergo reduction or hydrogenolysis to yield propane. However, this is not a practical or useful retrosynthesis, as the propyl halides are less abundant and would themselves likely be derived from propane.

The target molecule [Pr]Br is a simple alkyl bromide, specifically propyl bromide. There are a few straightforward ways this could be synthesized:

1. Direct bromination of propane using Br2 and light or heat. This would be a free radical halogenation reaction.

2. Nucleophilic substitution of 1-propanol using a bromide source like HBr or PBr3. The alcohol would act as the nucleophile, displacing the bromide.

3. Reduction of an acyl bromide like propanoyl bromide. A reducing agent like LiAlH4 could reduce the acyl bromide to the alkyl bromide.

Given the simplicity of the molecule, these cover the most plausible retrosynthetic pathways. The direct bromination would likely be the preferred route.

The most straightforward retrosynthesis would be a nucleophilic substitution reaction, replacing the bromine with another nucleophile. The bromine could have been installed by an electrophilic addition of Br2 or HBr to propene. Alternatively, the propyl group could come from nucleophilic addition of a propyl organometallic reagent to a bromine electrophile.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule [Pr]OC(C=O)CO[Pr] contains an acetal functional group, with two propoxy groups attached to the central carbon. The aldehyde C=O bond indicates this could be formed by oxidation of an alcohol. Alternatively, the acetal could be formed by acid-catalyzed addition of propanol to the aldehyde.
</thinking>

<thinking>
One retrosynthetic approach would be to disconnect one of the C-O propoxy bonds, giving an aldehyde with one propoxy group attached. This aldehyde could be formed by oxidation of the corresponding alcohol [Pr]OC(CO)CO.  
</thinking>

<thinking>
Another approach is to disconnect both propoxy C-O bonds, revealing the simple aldehyde OC(C=O)CO. This could be formed by oxidation of glycerol (OC(CO)CO). The acetal [Pr]OC(C=O)CO[Pr] would then be formed by acid-catalyzed addition of propanol to the aldehyde.
</thinking>

<thinking>
A third possibility is alkylation of the diol OC(CO)CO with propyl halide or propyl sulfonate, to install the propoxy groups. The central secondary alcohol would then be oxidized to the aldehyde in a second step.
</thinking>

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains three acetate ester groups attached to what appears to be a sugar or polyol backbone. A reasonable retrosynthesis would involve hydrolysis of the acetate esters to reveal the free hydroxyl groups.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The molecule has a plane of symmetry, with the two ends being primary alcohols and the three central carbons each bearing a secondary acetate. Hydrolysis should yield a symmetric 1,2,3,4,5-pentaol.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Based on the symmetry and substitution pattern, the polyol backbone is most likely xylitol, a naturally occurring sugar alcohol. Retrosynthesis via acetate hydrolysis should yield xylitol as the key precursor.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The acetylation to form the triacetate could be accomplished under standard conditions like acetic anhydride with pyridine or DMAP catalyst. The reverse hydrolysis would use aqueous base like sodium hydroxide or lithium hydroxide.
</thinking>

<thinking>
In summary, a one-step retrosynthesis of this triacetate would involve basic hydrolysis to yield xylitol as the main precursor. The high symmetry of the molecule limits the number of possibilities in this case.

<thinking>
The target molecule contains three acetate ester groups (OC(C)=O) and two terminal hydroxyl groups. A reasonable retrosynthesis would involve hydrolyzing the acetate esters to reveal hydroxyl groups.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The molecule has a symmetrical 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroxybutane core structure. This could potentially be obtained via dihydroxylation of but-2-ene-1,4-diol. The but-2-ene-1,4-diol could in turn be accessed by reduction of but-2-ynedioic acid.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Alternatively, the tetrahydroxybutane core could be synthesized by double nucleophilic addition of hydroxide or an alkoxide to diethyl maleate or diethyl fumarate, followed by reduction. The resulting tetraol could then be acetylated to give the target molecule.
</thinking>

<thinking>
The target molecule could also potentially be obtained by oxidative cleavage of a cyclic precursor such as myo-inositol or conduritol B, followed by acetylation of the resulting tetraol. However, this approach seems less straightforward.

<thinking>
The target molecule is hydrogen cyanide (HCN), a very simple molecule with just 3 atoms. It contains a carbon-nitrogen triple bond (nitrile group). There are limited meaningful retrosynthetic disconnections possible for such a small molecule.

One possibility is the dehydration of formamide, which would eliminate water to form the C≡N triple bond. This is a common way to make nitriles.

Alternatively, the oxidation of methylamine could provide HCN, with loss of 4 hydrogens. However, this would be an unusual transformation.

HCN could also potentially come from the decarbonylation of cyanogen, although this dimerization in the reverse direction seems unlikely. 

Given the simplicity of the target, there are no other realistic retrosynthetic precursors. Most industrial routes form HCN directly from the elements or from carbon and ammonia. Retrosynthetic analysis is of limited use for this small a molecule.

<thinking>
The target molecule is hydrogen cyanide (HCN), a simple nitrile with the formula N#C. As it is a very small molecule, there are limited meaningful retrosynthetic disconnections that can be made.

One possibility is the dehydration of formamide (HC(=O)N). This would involve heating formamide, likely with an acid catalyst, to eliminate water and form HCN.

Another option is the pyrolysis or cracking of a larger nitrile compound. For example, heating acetonitrile (CC#N) to a high temperature could break the C-C bond, eliminating a methyl radical and leaving HCN. 

HCN could also potentially be formed from the reaction of ammonia (N) with a C1 building block like carbon monoxide (C=O) under harsh conditions. However, this seems less likely than the other routes.

Given the simplicity of the target molecule, I don't think there are any other reasonable retrosynthetic suggestions. I will score the formamide dehydration route the highest, followed by nitrile pyrolysis. The ammonia/CO route will be given a low score. No other suggestions will be made due to the small size of the target.

<thinking>
The target molecule is hydrogen cyanide (HCN), a very simple molecule containing only carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen. The triple bond between carbon and nitrogen is the key functional group. Retrosynthesis of such a small molecule is quite limited.
</thinking>

<thinking>
One approach to make HCN could be the dehydration of formamide (HC(=O)NH2). The hydroxyl group could be eliminated using a dehydrating agent like phosphorus pentoxide. However, this is not a common method to make HCN.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Another possibility is the reaction of a cyanide salt like sodium cyanide (NaC#N) with a strong acid. The proton from the acid would protonate the CN-, forming HCN. This is probably the most straightforward way to make HCN, though handling cyanide salts requires great caution.
</thinking>

<thinking>
In theory, HCN could also be made by directly combining elemental hydrogen and cyanogen (NCCN) gas. However, cyanogen is also highly toxic and not a common precursor. The reaction conditions would also be difficult to control.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Given the simplicity of the target molecule, there are no other reasonable single-step retrosynthetic approaches. The most plausible precursor is a cyanide salt. Formamide dehydration is a possibility but less likely. Direct combination of H2 and cyanogen is theoretically possible but not practical.

The target molecule is molecular hydrogen, H2. This is an extremely simple molecule consisting of just two hydrogen atoms bonded together. There are no functional groups or carbon atoms to disconnect. Molecular hydrogen is typically produced industrially from methane or water, but these would not be considered direct precursors in a retrosynthetic sense, as they require multiple steps and reagents to convert to H2.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Given the simplicity of H2, there are no meaningful single-step retrosynthetic disconnections that can be made. Any precursor molecule would be more complex than the target H2 molecule itself. Molecular hydrogen is often considered a feedstock chemical rather than a target for synthesis.
</thinking>

<thinking>
In conclusion, the target molecule H2 is too simple to propose any reasonable retrosynthetic precursors. It is an elementary molecule that cannot be broken down further using retrosynthetic analysis. No suggestions for precursor molecules or reactions can be made in this case.
