  "literature_reaction": "Pd-catalyzed dehalogenation of aryl halides",
  "explanation": "This is a palladium-catalyzed hydrodehalogenation reaction to reduce an aryl chloride to the corresponding arene. The key reagents are a palladium catalyst and potassium acetate base. Polar aprotic solvents like DMF or DMA and elevated temperatures are typically required."
