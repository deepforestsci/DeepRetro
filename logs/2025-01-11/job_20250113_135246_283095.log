    "This is an acylation reaction between an acyl chloride and an aromatic amine. The acyl chloride (CC(N)C(=O)Cl) reacts with the aromatic amine (Cc1cccc(C)c1N) to form an amide bond.",
    "The reaction is typically performed in the presence of a base such as hydroxide ([OH-]) or triethylamine to neutralize the HCl byproduct and drive the reaction to completion."

  "explanation": "This reaction involves the oxidation of an oxime (CC(=NO)C(=O)Cl) to the corresponding nitro compound (CC(N)C(=O)Cl) using molecular oxygen (O2) as the oxidant. The reaction likely proceeds via a radical mechanism. Key conditions include low temperature (0 °C) to control the exothermic reaction. No additional solvent is needed as the reactants are liquids. The transformation is rapid, completing within minutes."

  "explanation": "This is an acylation reaction between an acid chloride (propionyl chloride) and an oxime (isobutyraldehyde oxime). The acid chloride acts as an electrophile, reacting with the nucleophilic oxime nitrogen to form an N-acyl oxime intermediate. Subsequent rearrangement leads to the acyl nitroso product. The reaction likely proceeds readily at 0-25 °C without additional reagents or solvents."
