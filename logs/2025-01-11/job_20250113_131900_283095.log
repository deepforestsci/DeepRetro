2025-01-13 13:19:45 [info     ] Received response from LLM: {
  "literature_reaction": "Acetylation of an aromatic amine (aniline derivative) using acetic anhydride",
  "explanation": "This is a classic acetylation reaction of an aromatic amine (4-aminophenol) using acetic anhydride as the acetylating agent. The reaction occurs readily under reflux conditions (80-100°C) without the need for additional solvent or reagents. The electron-donating hydroxyl group on the aniline ring increases the nucleophilicity of the amine, facilitating the reaction with acetic anhydride to form the amide product (4-acetamidophenol or paracetamol)."
