2025-01-13 13:22:28 [info     ] Received response from LLM: {
  "literature_reaction": "Base-catalyzed ester hydrolysis of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin)",
  "explanation": "The reaction is a base-catalyzed ester hydrolysis, where the acetyl group of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is cleaved by hydroxide ions to form salicylic acid and acetic acid. The reaction is typically carried out in an aqueous solution at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, with reaction times ranging from 30 minutes to 2 hours. The key reagent is the hydroxide ion (OH-), which acts as a nucleophile and a base to facilitate the hydrolysis of the ester bond."
