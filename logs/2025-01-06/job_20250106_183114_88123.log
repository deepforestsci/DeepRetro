  "literature_reaction": "Reduction of oximes to primary amines using sodium borohydride (NaBH4)",
  "explanation": "The conversion of an oxime (R1R2C=NOH) to a primary amine (R1R2CH-NH2) is a reduction reaction. This transformation is commonly achieved using reducing agents such as sodium borohydride (NaBH4) or catalytic hydrogenation. The reaction is typically carried out in protic solvents like methanol or water at mild temperatures (0-25째C). In this case, the oxime is reduced to the corresponding primary amine using water as the solvent at 0째C."

  "data": [],
  "explanation": ["This reaction does not require any additional reagents. It is a simple acyl chloride formation from the carboxylic acid CCC(=O)Cl, with the nitrosamine CC(C)CCON=O acting as a leaving group. The reaction likely proceeds under mild conditions without the need for catalysts or other reagents."]

  "literature_reaction": "Acid chloride reacts with an oxime to form an acyl nitroso compound, as described in J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. 1, 1999, 1695-1701.",
  "explanation": "This is an acylation reaction between an acid chloride (propionyl chloride) and an oxime (isobutyraldehyde oxime). The acid chloride acts as an electrophile, reacting with the nucleophilic oxime nitrogen to form an N-acyl oxime intermediate. Subsequent rearrangement leads to the acyl nitroso product. The reaction likely proceeds readily at 0-25 째C without additional reagents or solvents."
