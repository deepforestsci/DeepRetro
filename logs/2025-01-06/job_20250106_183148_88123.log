  "literature_reaction": "Reduction of a nitro group to an amine using hydrogen gas and a metal catalyst",
  "explanation": "This reaction involves the reduction of a nitro group (R-NO2) to a primary amine (R-NH2) using molecular hydrogen (H2) as the reducing agent. The reaction typically requires a metal catalyst such as palladium on carbon (Pd/C) or Raney nickel. The solvent is usually an alcohol like ethanol or methanol, and the reaction is carried out at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The reaction time is generally 1-2 hours for complete conversion."

2025-01-06 13:02:26 [info     ] Received response from LLM: {
  "literature_reaction": "Aldol addition of a nitroalkane to an aromatic aldehyde",
  "explanation": "This is an aldol addition reaction between a nitroalkane (nitroethane) and an aromatic aldehyde (3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde) under basic conditions using hydroxide as the base. The reaction likely proceeds via deprotonation of the nitroalkane to form a resonance-stabilized nitronate anion, which then undergoes nucleophilic addition to the aldehyde carbonyl group. The reaction is performed at low temperature (0-5 °C) in ethanol solvent to control the selectivity and avoid side reactions. The key reagent is the hydroxide base, which generates the reactive nitronate nucleophile."
