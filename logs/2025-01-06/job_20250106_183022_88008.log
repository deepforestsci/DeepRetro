  "explanation": [
    "This is an acylation reaction between an acyl chloride and an aromatic amine. The acyl chloride (CC(N)C(=O)Cl) reacts with the aromatic amine (Cc1cccc(C)c1N) to form an amide bond.",
    "The reaction is typically performed in the presence of a base such as hydroxide ([OH-]) or triethylamine to neutralize the HCl byproduct and drive the reaction to completion."
