2025-01-10 20:43:21 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the single-step retrosynthesis analysis for the given molecule ClC(C(OC)=C1)=CC2=C1[C@@H]3[C@@H](N(C)CC2)CCC4=CC=CC=C43:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains several key functional groups and structural features to consider for retrosynthesis:
1. An aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent 
2. A methoxy group on the aromatic ring
3. A tetrahydroisoquinoline core fused to the chlorinated aromatic ring
4. A phenyl ring fused to the tetrahydroisoquinoline 
5. A tertiary amine in the tetrahydroisoquinoline with a methyl substituent
The aromatic chlorination and methoxy group suggest potential late-stage functionalization. The tetrahydroisoquinoline core could arise from a Pictet-Spengler reaction between a β-arylethylamine and an aldehyde or ketone. The fused phenyl ring hints at a precursor with a biphenyl moiety.
</thinking>

<thinking>
One approach could be to first disconnect the C-Cl bond and the C-OMe bond. This suggests two precursors:
1. The non-chlorinated, phenolic tetrahydroisoquinoline 
2. A chlorinating agent like NCS and a methylating agent like MeI
The tetrahydroisoquinoline precursor could come from a Pictet-Spengler reaction between a β-arylethylamine and formaldehyde. The β-arylethylamine in turn could arise from reduction of a β-arylethylazide, which could be made from a biphenyl-containing azide by a copper-catalyzed or thermal azide-alkyne cycloaddition.
</thinking>

<thinking>
An alternative approach is to disconnect the C-N bond in the tetrahydroisoquinoline. This suggests an intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution between:
1. A biphenyl precursor with a leaving group (e.g. F) ortho to one phenyl ring and a primary amine meta to the other phenyl ring
2. A 1,2-dielectrophile like bromoacetaldehyde to form the two C-N bonds
The biphenyl precursor could be made by a Suzuki coupling between a halophenyl boronic acid and a 3-nitrophenyl halide, followed by nitro reduction.
</thinking>

<thinking>
A third approach is to disconnect the C-C bond between the tetrahydroisoquinoline and the fused phenyl ring. This suggests a Pictet-Spengler reaction between:
1. A β-arylethylamine with the chlorinated, methoxylated phenyl ring 
2. Phenylacetaldehyde
The β-arylethylamine precursor could come from reduction of the corresponding nitroalkene, which in turn could be made by a Henry reaction between nitromethane and the appropriate chlorinated, methoxylated benzaldehyde.
</thinking>

2025-01-10 20:44:51 [info     ] Received response from LLM: Here is the retrosynthetic analysis for the target molecule OC1=CC2=C(C=C1)C3CCCCC3N(C)CC2:

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule contains a tetrahydroisoquinoline core fused to a phenol ring. Key disconnections to consider are:
1) Pictet-Spengler reaction to form the tetrahydroisoquinoline from a phenethylamine and aldehyde/ketone
2) Bischler-Napieralski reaction to form the imine, followed by reduction
3) Nucleophilic addition of the phenol to an imine or iminium ion
4) Alkylation of the phenol, such as via a Mitsunobu reaction
</thinking>

<thinking>
For a Pictet-Spengler approach, the precursors would be:
- 2-(3-hydroxyphenyl)ethylmethylamine 
- Cyclohexanone
This would form the C-N bond and close the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. Acidic conditions are required.
</thinking>

<thinking>
A Bischler-Napieralski reaction would involve:
- N-[2-(3-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]-N-methylcyclohexanecarboxamide
This forms the imine after activation of the amide. Reduction of the imine gives the tetrahydroisoquinoline. POCl3 is a typical activating agent.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Nucleophilic addition of the phenol to an iminium could be achieved with precursors:
- 3-hydroxyphenethylamine
- N-methylcyclohexanimine
The phenol oxygen would add to the imine carbon. Acidic conditions would facilitate iminium formation. A dehydrating agent like MgSO4 may be needed.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Alkylation of the phenol could be a final step. Possible precursors:
- 6-hydroxy-1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline 
- Cyclohexanol
A Mitsunobu reaction with DEAD/DIAD and PPh3 could be used to alkylate the phenol oxygen with the alcohol.
</thinking>

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule ClC#N is a simple nitrile compound with a chlorine substituent. It contains a carbon-nitrogen triple bond (C≡N) characteristic of nitriles. The molecule is quite small, so there are limited options for retrosynthesis.
</thinking>

<thinking>
One approach to form ClC#N would be the dehydration of a primary amide precursor with the formula ClCH2C(O)NH2. This would require a dehydrating agent like phosphorus oxychloride (POCl3) or thionyl chloride (SOCl2). However, this precursor amide is not commercially available and would itself require synthesis.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Another potential route is the chlorination of hydrogen cyanide (HC#N). This could be accomplished using chlorine gas (Cl2) with a suitable chlorination catalyst like FeCl3. The H-C≡N molecule is simple but quite toxic and dangerous to work with.
</thinking>

<thinking>
A third retrosynthetic route could involve the reaction of cyanogen chloride (ClC#N) itself with a strong reducing agent like LiAlH4 to reduce the nitrile to an amine (ClCH2NH2), followed by re-oxidation. But this seems an unnecessarily roundabout approach.

The molecule is quite simple, so the retrosynthetic options are limited. The chlorination of HCN seems the most direct route, but the use of HCN has safety concerns. The amide dehydration route could work but requires an additional step to make the amide precursor. Overall, this is a case where a simple one-step synthesis is likely preferable to retrosynthetic analysis. filename=llm.py job_id=20250110_204143_190868 lineno=68

The target molecule ClC#N is a simple nitrile compound with a chlorine atom attached. Being a very small molecule with limited complexity, there are not many meaningful retrosynthetic disconnections that can be made. The main bond that could be formed is the carbon-nitrogen triple bond of the nitrile group. 
</thinking>

<thinking>
One possible precursor could be ClC(=O)NH2, a chlorinated amide. The amide could undergo dehydration to form the nitrile. However, this is not a very common synthetic route.
Confidence score: 0.4
</thinking>

<thinking>
A more plausible precursor is ClCN, cyanogen chloride. This could be reduced to form the target nitrile. Metal catalyzed reductions or hydrogenation could potentially achieve this transformation, though specific conditions would need to be screened.

Given the small size and limited complexity of the target molecule, there are no other meaningful precursors to suggest. Most retrosynthetic analysis would focus on how to install the chlorine atom on a pre-formed nitrile, rather than disconnecting the C-N triple bond itself. The molecule is simply too small for multiple retrosynthetic steps to be practical.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule ClC#N is a simple nitrile compound with a chlorine atom attached. Possible retrosynthetic disconnections to consider:

1. Disconnecting the C-Cl bond, which could be formed via chlorination of the corresponding alkyne (HC#N). This would be a simple SN2 reaction.

2. Disconnecting the C#N triple bond. This could be formed via dehydration of the corresponding amide (Cl-CH2-C(=O)NH2). Typical conditions would be SOCl2 or other dehydrating agents.

3. Disconnecting both the C-Cl and C#N bonds simultaneously. This suggests ClCH2CN as a precursor, which could undergo elimination to give the target molecule. Typical bases for elimination could be used, like NaOH or NaOEt.

Given the simplicity of the molecule, these are the most plausible retrosynthetic pathways. The chlorination and elimination pathways are likely the most feasible.

Given the simplicity of the molecule, I don't think there are any other meaningful retrosynthetic disconnections to consider. The most plausible precursors are the chloroalkyne, amide, and chloroalkyne + cyanide salt.

<thinking>
To represent the precursors in SMILES notation:

1. Chloroalkyne: ClC#C
2. Amide: ClCC(=O)N  
3. Chloroalkyne + NaCN: ClC#C.N#C.[Na+]

I'm quite confident in disconnections #1 and #2, as those are very straightforward reactions. Disconnection #3 is plausible but perhaps a bit less likely to be used in practice compared to the others.

<cot>
<thinking>
The target molecule is sodium cyanide, consisting of a cyanide anion (CN-) and a sodium cation (Na+). This is an ionic compound, not a covalent molecule, so traditional retrosynthetic disconnections do not apply. 

Sodium cyanide could potentially be made by an acid-base reaction between hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). However, HCN is an extremely toxic gas, so this is not a preferred synthetic route.

Alternatively, sodium cyanide could be produced by heating sodium metal with a cyanide salt like potassium cyanide (KCN). This would involve a cation exchange reaction. However, this requires handling highly toxic cyanide salts.

Another possibility is the carbothermal reduction of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) with carbon (coke) at high temperatures (~1000°C). This is the main industrial process for producing sodium cyanide. However, it requires specialized equipment for the high temperatures.

Given the hazardous nature of the precursors and special equipment needed, sodium cyanide is not a good candidate for lab-scale synthesis and is best obtained from commercial sources when needed. Proposing viable retrosynthetic precursors is therefore challenging for this molecule.

Hydrogen cyanide is a very simple molecule consisting of just hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen. With only 3 atoms, there are limited options for retrosynthesis.

One approach would be to break the C-H bond, giving the cyanide anion [C-]#N. This could come from a metal cyanide salt like sodium cyanide. 

Alternatively, breaking the C≡N triple bond would give a carbene [:C] and a nitrene [N:]. However, these are very high energy intermediates that are unlikely to be practical precursors.

Given the simplicity of the molecule, hydrogen cyanide is more likely to be used as a precursor itself rather than being a target for synthesis. Industrial production is by the Andrussow process or from ammonia and methane. Lab scale preparation is from the dehydration of formamide.

In summary, the only plausible retrosynthetic precursor is a metal cyanide. But in practice, hydrogen cyanide is too simple a molecule for retrosynthesis to be meaningful.

Hydrogen cyanide can be formed via an elimination reaction, such as from aminoacetonitrile. But this is not a common or practical precursor.

<cot>
<thinking>
Hydrogen cyanide is a very simple molecule with only 3 atoms. It contains a C-H bond and a C≡N triple bond. Potential retrosynthetic disconnections could target:
1) The C-H bond, replacing the H with another functional group 
2) The C≡N triple bond, reducing it to a double or single C-N bond
3) Complete fragmentation of the molecule into C1 building blocks
However, given the small size and lack of complexity, there are limited meaningful retrosynthetic routes.
</thinking>

<thinking>
One potential precursor could be obtained by replacing the H with a leaving group like a halogen (Cl, Br, I). This would give a halocyanide compound that could undergo reduction or substitution to give hydrogen cyanide. For example:
ClC#N + H2 (or other reducing agent) → [H]C#N + HCl
The reaction would be a reduction using hydrogen gas or another reducing agent. Key considerations would be avoiding over-reduction of the C≡N triple bond.
</thinking>

<thinking>
Another precursor could be cyanogen, NC-CN. Partial hydrogenation or reduction of cyanogen could cleave one of the C≡N bonds to give hydrogen cyanide:
NC-CN + H2 → [H]C#N + HCN 
Reaction is a partial hydrogenation. Would need to control stoichiometry of hydrogen to avoid over-reduction to methylamine. Transition metal catalyst likely needed.
</thinking>

<thinking>
A third precursor is methane and nitrogen gas. At very high temperatures, these could react to give hydrogen cyanide:
CH4 + N2 → [H]C#N + 3 H2
This is an extreme example and not a practical synthetic route. It would require very forcing conditions (high temp, catalysts) and the equilibrium likely lies toward the methane/nitrogen side. Shown more as a thought experiment.

The target molecule is dinitrogen, N2. This is an extremely simple molecule consisting of just a triple bond between two nitrogen atoms. There are no obvious retrosynthetic disconnections that can be made.

Dinitrogen is abundant in the atmosphere and is typically obtained by separating it from air through liquefaction and fractional distillation. It is not usually synthesized in the lab.

The triple bond is very strong (945 kJ/mol) making it quite inert. Breaking this bond to obtain reactive nitrogen species requires very harsh conditions.

Overall, there are no meaningful retrosynthetic precursors to suggest for dinitrogen itself. The molecule is too simple to apply retrosynthesis in a useful way.

The target molecule is dinitrogen, N2. This is an extremely simple molecule consisting of just a triple bond between two nitrogen atoms. Given its simplicity, there are not many meaningful retrosynthetic disconnections that can be made.

N2 is an inert, gaseous molecule that makes up 78% of the Earth's atmosphere. It is not typically synthesized in the lab, but rather isolated from air. The triple bond is very strong (945 kJ/mol) making it difficult to break.

One could conceptualize breaking the N-N triple bond to give two nitrogen radical species, but this would be extremely high in energy and not a realistic transformation. Nitrogen radicals do not exist in any stable form.

Given the lack of other atoms besides nitrogen, there are no obvious functional group interconversions or protecting group strategies that could be applied here in a retrosynthetic sense.

In summary, the dinitrogen molecule is too simple to provide any meaningful retrosynthetic analysis in a conventional sense. Suggesting any precursors or reactions would be unrealistic from a synthetic chemistry perspective.

The target molecule is dinitrogen, N2. This is an extremely simple molecule consisting of just a triple bond between two nitrogen atoms. Given its simplicity, there are very limited meaningful retrosynthetic disconnections that can be made.

N2 is the most thermodynamically stable form of nitrogen. Nearly all nitrogen-containing compounds can eventually be reduced to give N2. However, going in the reverse direction is very challenging due to the high stability of the N-N triple bond.

The main way to make N2 is by decomposition or oxidation reactions of nitrogen compounds like ammonia, hydrazine, azides, etc. Direct synthesis from atomic nitrogen would require very high temperatures to break the N-N triple bond.

Given the limited options and extreme conditions required, it is difficult to propose reasonable retrosynthetic precursors for a single step synthesis of N2. The molecule is too simple for meaningful retrosynthetic analysis.

The target molecule is dinitrogen, N2. This is an extremely simple molecule consisting of a triple bond between two nitrogen atoms. Being composed of only nitrogen, there are very few reasonable retrosynthetic disconnections that can be made.

One possibility is homolytic cleavage of the N-N triple bond to give two nitrogen radicals. However, this is not a practical synthetic route.

Alternatively, the molecule could be obtained directly from the thermal decomposition of azides like NaN3. Again though, this is more of a degradation than a useful synthetic reaction.

Overall, N2 is too simple of a molecule for meaningful retrosynthetic analysis in most contexts. It is usually obtained directly from the atmosphere (air is 78% N2) rather than synthesized.

The target molecule is sodium hydroxide, [Na+].[OH-]. This is an ionic compound consisting of a sodium cation and a hydroxide anion. Sodium hydroxide is a simple inorganic compound, not an organic molecule. As such, it is not amenable to traditional retrosynthetic analysis used for complex organic molecules.

Sodium hydroxide can be formed by various simple methods, such as:
1. The reaction of sodium metal with water 
2. The electrolysis of a sodium chloride solution
3. The reaction of sodium carbonate or sodium oxide with water

Given the simplicity of the target molecule, a full retrosynthetic analysis is not particularly meaningful in this case. The provided suggestions will focus on the direct formation of sodium hydroxide rather than multi-step retrosynthetic pathways.
