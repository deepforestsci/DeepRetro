  "literature_reaction": "Schotten-Baumann reaction",
  "explanation": "The reaction between an acyl chloride (CC(N)C(=O)Cl) and an amine (Cc1cccc(C)c1N) to form an amide (Cc1cccc(C)c1NC(=O)C(C)N) under basic conditions ([OH-]) is a Schotten-Baumann reaction. The reaction is typically carried out at 0-25 °C in solvents like DCM or THF for 1-4 hours. The base (hydroxide ion) is required to neutralize the HCl byproduct and drive the reaction to completion."

2024-12-23 15:54:44 [info     ] Received response from LLM: {
  "literature_reaction": "Oxidation of oximes to nitro compounds using molecular oxygen",
  "explanation": "This reaction involves the oxidation of an oxime (CC(=NO)C(=O)Cl) to the corresponding nitro compound (CC(N)C(=O)Cl) using molecular oxygen (O2) as the oxidant. The reaction likely proceeds via a radical mechanism. Key conditions include low temperature (0 °C) to control the exothermic reaction. No additional solvent is needed as both the oxime and product are liquids. The transformation is rapid, completing within minutes."

  "explanation": "The reaction between a carboxylic acid (CCC(=O)Cl) and nitrosyl chloride (CC(C)CCON=O) rapidly forms an acid chloride (CC(=NO)C(=O)Cl) at 0-25 °C without solvent. The nitrosyl group (-N=O) is transferred from the nitrosyl chloride to the acid, displacing the hydroxyl group and forming the acid chloride. This is a useful method for preparing acid chlorides under mild conditions."
