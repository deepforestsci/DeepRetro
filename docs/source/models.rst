Models Used in DeepRetro
========================

.. TODO: Provide an overview of the machine learning models used in this project.

AiZynthFinder Models
--------------------

- Brief description of AiZynthFinder and its role in retrosynthesis.
- How to download/acquire the necessary models (refer to ``readme.md`` or ``installation.rst`` instructions).
- Expected path: ``aizynthfinder/models/``
- Link to AiZynthFinder documentation or original source if available.

Reaction Prediction Model
-------------------------

- Description of the reaction classification model (e.g., ``reaction_prediction/rfc.pkl``).
- Its purpose in the workflow.
- Origin or training details (if public/relevant).
- Expected path: ``reaction_prediction/rfc.pkl``

Large Language Models (LLMs)
----------------------------

- Mention the integration with LLMs (Anthropic, OpenAI).
- How API keys for these are configured (refer to ``configuration.rst``).
- General role of LLMs in the project's workflow.
